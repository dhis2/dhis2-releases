Through configuration in the Android Settings Web App, administrators can define how the Capture App launches external apps, sends data to them, and receives results automatically. It can be configured per tracked entity attribute or data element and support both data entry (tracker and event programs) and search workflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-6576\">JIRA</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sync by working list:</strong>\nSynchronization can now be configured based on working lists defined in the Capture web app and managed through the Android Settings Web App (ASWA).

This feature provides granular control over who can access each version of the app, ensuring secure and efficient distribution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible User Group Assignments</strong>: User groups can now be assigned to multiple \"Android app versions\". However, users within these groups will only access the latest version allocated to their group, simplifying version management and ensuring users always have access to the most up-to-date app version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Instance-wide Access Management</strong>: It is now possible to not assign a user group to a \"Android app version.\" In such cases, all users within that instance will automatically gain access to that version, streamlining access management for administrators.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Default Version Handling</strong>: In instances where more than one \"Android app version\" remains unassigned to any user group, the latest version will automatically be designated as the \"Default.\" This ensures that only the latest version is accessible to all users within the instance, maintaining consistency and minimizing confusion.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These new features allow administrators with greater flexibility and control over app version distribution, simplifying access management and ensuring a seamless user experience for all. </p>\n<h3>RELEASE INFO:</h3>\n<p>Release Information | Link\n-- | --\nDownload app from the App Hub | https://apps.dhis2.org/\nDocumentation | <a href=\"https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/apk-distribution.html\">APK Distribution Web App doc</a>\nIssues related | <a href=\"https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-14958\">Jira issues</a></p>"

Users are prompted to select new Data Elements to ensure compliance with the updated value type requirements, minimizing errors and ensuring data accuracy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>: To enforce adherence to the new valid value type, the \"Next\" and \"Done\" buttons within the configuration interface remain disabled until users select Data Elements that meet the updated requirements. This proactive approach streamlines configuration processes and reduces the risk of configuration errors.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these enhancements, the web app empowers administrators to maintain data integrity and configurability within their DHIS2 ecosystem. </p>\n<h3>RELEASE INFO:</h3>\n<p>Release Information | Link\n-- | --\nDownload app from the App Hub | https://apps.dhis2.org/\nDocumentation | <a href=\"https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/use-case-configuration.html\">Use Case Configuration Web App doc</a>\nIssues related | <a href=\"https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-13625\">Jira issues</a></p>"
