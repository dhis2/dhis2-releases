This is also confusing when selecting fixed periods, 1.12.2024 to 31.12.2024 and seeing data for the month, but when selecting a period that does not cover first to last day of the month, data is not shown. \n\nAnother example of confusion is, if I select the 1st until the 30th of November 2024, data shows up, but if I select a relative period of the last 60 days (which includes the whole November 2024), no data is shown.\n\nI’m guessing there’s a reasonable explanation for that, but as a first time user of the Map app, it’s hard to figure out why.",

For example, in one of our dashboards, we provide links to various tutorials and user guides to help users better navigate and utilize DHIS2. These links lead to external resources, such as training material hosted on other platforms.\nWe would like to request the integration of a similar feature into the DHIS2 Android app. This would enable app users to access documentation, tutorials, or short videos directly from their mobile devices. The goal is to provide the same level of support and training resources for mobile users as we currently do for web users.\n**Proposed Features:**\n\n** **Resource Repository:** A section in the Android app where documentation, links, or videos can be attached and accessed.\n** **Dashboard Integration:** The ability to display and link these resources from within dashboards in the app.\n** **Offline Access :** An option to download specific resources for offline use.\nImpact:\nThis feature would greatly enhance user experience and ensure that DHIS2 app users have the necessary support and training resources at their fingaertips, fostering better adoption and utilization of the platform.\n**Steps to Reproduce (current behavior):**\n** Navigate to the DHIS2 web version.\n** Go to **Reports** > **Resource** and store links/documents.\n** Observe that these resources are not accessible from the Android app.\nThank you for considering this feature request!",

It’s especially important for large organizations or country implementations where there are numerous dashboards for different programs, projects, or regions. These users need efficient dashboard organization to enhance usability, improve workflow efficiency, and reduce the cognitive load of finding the right dashboards for specific tasks.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users work around this limitation by using naming conventions to group dashboards or manually scrolling through the dashboard list to locate the relevant one. This can be time-consuming, especially in implementations with a high volume of dashboards. Additionally, users may rely on keeping lists of dashboard names, but these approaches are neither efficient nor scalable in environments with complex dashboard structures.",

This feature would be especially valuable in high-usage contexts where users repeatedly enter data for the same set of organization units, as it would help them perform their tasks more efficiently.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users manually search through the full list of organization units each time they enter data. In cases with extensive hierarchies, this requires scrolling and searching, which can be time-consuming and error prone.",

This feature is required if the either DHIS2 is not integrated with an upstream, national eLMIS which therefore cannot automatically calculate replenishment orders using the VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) concept or if stakeholders refuse to use VMI for stock replenishment and want the healthcare facilities to decide on stock replenishment orders.\n\nThe required calculation is in principle simple:\n\nAverage distributions of the past 90 days, multiplied with a fixed factor (for example 3) from which then the stock on hand is subtracted.\n\nThe distribution quantities of each transaction are recorded in DHIS2-RTS as a separate event and a quantity in the \"Distribution\" Data element (Tracker data element).\n\nThe stock on hand is also available in the DHIS2-RTS as another Data element (Last value)\n\nThe functionality which is missing and required is allowing the user to:\n\n** use a Program indicator in a program rule, or\n\n** configure a new d2: function which allows aggregating the Data element values of a Tracker program event across a defined period (for example the last 90 days)\n\n**As a DHIS2 user**, storekeeper in a healthcare facility using DHIS2-RTS for recording transactions.\n\n**When** - prepare the (monthly) stock replenishment order\n\n**I want to** - review an automated calculation in DHIS2-RTS\n\n**So I can** - order according to a sound, systematic and rational inventory control policy\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAny storekeeper who needs to place a (monthly) order using the DHIS2-RTS application\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nManual calculation on paper, with a calculator or a spreadsheet.",

If more  than one OUs the admin needs to assign the OUs manually to the user from the user profile.* \n\n*OrgUnit groups are used to assign datasets but are not available for assignment of users.* \n\nAs a **[DHIS2 user]**\n\nWhen I use the Data entry or Capture app\n\nI want to - *only see the OUs that belong to a specific OU group according to the user group/s that I belong to*\n\nSo I can easily detect them in the OU list and save time  \n\n how important is it to them? \n\n*As an Adnin,*\n\n*When I create a user* \n\n*I want to be able to assign to the user an OU group in combination to the OU level they have access to.* \n\n*For example, if a user is supposed to enter data for all hospitals in Nigeria, I should be able to assign to the user Nigeria as an OU but also the OUgroup “Hospitals”* \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nToday, admins do not have the capacity to assign OUs individually due to the amount of users and the amount of OUs . As a result, users see all OUs within a country even the ones that are not relevant to them . This affects heavily the user experience and increases the amount of time they spend to identify the right OUs to enter data for . \n\n##",

Storekeepers select the items they want to order one by one and then enter the order quantity. Healthcare facilities need to purchase all goods from the central medical store and have limited budgets. Therefore they would like to calculate the value of their orders “on the fly”. This calculation is possible with a Program indicator but requires saving the Event, then moving to the analytics screen, checking the total value and then moving back to the main Event program screen.\n\n!image-20240926-153301.png|width=361,height=743,alt=\"image-20240926-153301.png\"!\n\n**As a storekeeper (DHIS2 user)**\n\n**When** – placing an order in the dedicated Event program\n\n**I want to** – view the updated total cost of my order on the Event home screen\n\n**So I can** – adjust the ordered items and quantities without having to switch between UIs.\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAll users of 90 healthcare facilities in the Comoros whenever they place their orders, usually two to three times per month.\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nUsers calculate the order value manually with a calculator.",

Every storekeeper must use the most recent stock on hand data from the storekeeper on the previous shift or who worked on the previous day. However, currently the Capture Android app data is cached by user/instance/device which means that every storekeeper would be using the stock data from their previous shift, even if it was days or even weeks ago (in case of sick leave or holidays). This means that any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between two logins of a certain user, will always be wrong for every user. Two work arounds are available but are both not ideal for different reasons.\n\n**As a DHIS2 administrator**\n\n**When** – implementing DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management tool) anywhere\n\n**I want to** – force mobile devices to synchronise (only) the DHIS2-RTS Tracker program during login and logout\n\n**So the next user –** will use the correct and most recent stock position (of the user which was previously logged in) and not the stock position of the user who is logging in. This user might have logged in the last time days ago (or even weeks ago in case of sick leave or holidays) and the cached stock position will be completely outdated.\n\n**Who faces the problem**\n\nThis problem was encountered during the current DHIS2-RTS implementation (September 2024) in the Comoros but all DHIS2-RTS implementations are affected.\n\nAll users are affected by this problem and if there is more than one user using the same mobile device, the stock position will always be wrong for all users. To be precise: any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between the login of a certain user, will be wrong.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nThe problem can be avoided by ensuring that all users synchronises the mobile device right after logging in and right before logging out. However, sooner or later a user will forget. Morever, the Internet connection is not always available and if a user cannot synchronise data before going home, s/he will not wait for the Internet to return.\n\nThe current solution is to simply ask all users to use the same credentials which is not ideal from a security point of view.\n\n**Proposed feature**\n\nThe DHIS2 Administrator has the option of “forcing” the synchronisation for a specific Program after login and during logout in the Android-settings app which gives users a choice.",

However, I have observed that presenting the entire form at once can be overwhelming and may lead to data entry errors. \n\nTo enhance the user experience and improve data accuracy, I propose a feature that allows data collectors to view and respond to one question at a time, with the ability to navigate to the next question by swiping. This approach would help maintain focus on each question, reduce cognitive load, and ensure that data collectors can complete the forms efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Use Case:** **Expected Behavior:**\n\n** **Single-Question Display:** When a data entry form is opened in the Android app, only one question should be displayed at a time.\n** **Swipe Navigation:** Data collectors should be able to swipe left or right to move to the next or previous question, respectively.\n** **Progress Indicator:** A progress bar or a question number indicator at the top or bottom of the screen would help users track their progress through the form.\n** **Data Validation:** As each question is answered, the app should validate the input before allowing the user to proceed to the next question. If there is an error, an appropriate message should be displayed.\n** **Review Mode:* After completing all the questions, data collectors should have the option to review their answers before final submission, either by swiping through the questions again or by viewing a summary screen.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*This is faced by the DHIS2 Android Capture users (field workers).*\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*There’s not currently a way round this in DHIS2*\n\nThis feature would greatly enhance the data collection process, particularly in scenarios where attention to detail is critical. I believe it would be a valuable addition to the DHIS2 Android app and would be appreciated by many users in the field.",

We have moved from a Lotus Note application to DHIS2 and this function was very important for the health data analysis when looking at the aggregation of data / analytics. We do work with partners in our operations, and we do collect data from them, and we therefore need to be able to assess if the data that we have is not reliable.

      "description": "**Description:**\n\nWe propose the addition of wild card search and best match functionality within the DHIS2 Data Entry app to improve the efficiency and user experience of searching for organization units.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe current search functionality in the DHIS2 Data Entry/ Data visualizer app does not support wild card searches or best match results, which can hinder users' ability to quickly and accurately find specific organization units. Implementing these features will streamline the search process, reducing the time and effort required for data entry.\n\n1. Key Benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced User Experience:\n#** Users will be able to perform more flexible and intuitive searches, increasing satisfaction and productivity.\n1. Improved Efficiency:\n#** The ability to use wild card searches and view best match results will reduce the time spent searching for organization units, allowing users to complete data entry tasks more quickly.\n1. Greater Accuracy:\n#** Best match functionality will help users find the most relevant organization units, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n1. Scope and Requirements:\n\n1. Wild Card Search:\n#** Implement wild card search capabilities to allow partial matches. For example, searching for \"Hosp**\" should return all organization units that start with \"Hosp\".\n1. Best Match Results:\n#** Introduce an algorithm to rank search results based on relevance, displaying the best matches at the top of the list.\n1. User Interface Adjustments:\n#** Modify the search interface to accommodate and display these new search features clearly.\n\n1. ICRC Specific Needs:\n\n** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) manages a large number of organization units. This vast hierarchy makes it challenging for users, especially those at higher levels, to find specific facilities quickly.\n** Variations in language and the use of accents or special characters can lead to inconsistencies in the names of organization units, further complicating the search process. For example, a facility's name might differ slightly depending on the language or presence of accented characters, making it difficult to locate using the current search functionality.\n** Implementing wild card searches and best match results will greatly assist our users by accommodating these variations and improving the accuracy and speed of their searches.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWhile the initial implementation may require adjustments in the backend search algorithms and interface design, the long-term benefits in terms of improved search efficiency and user satisfaction are significant. This feature will also position DHIS2 as a more user-friendly platform, potentially attracting more users and use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe believe that adding wild card search and best match functionality to the DHIS2 Data Entry app is a valuable enhancement that will greatly benefit users, particularly within the ICRC, by making the search process more efficient and accurate. We request that this feature be considered for inclusion in the DHIS2 roadmap.",

      "description": "## Confluence\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQADJ](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/wiki/x/AQADJ)\n\n \n\n## High level use case and user´s description\n\n----\n\n**High level use case:** better data entry interfaces for tracker implementations where secondary data entry is done (i.e. most)\n\n**Users:** tracker data entry users\n\n## The problem you are trying to solve\n\n----\n\nMost tracker data entry is secondary. The wide use of custom forms for aggregate data sets indicate that replicating the format/structure of the source document is the preferred way to do data entry from paper forms.\n\nThe current Capture app does not support this. First, custom forms are not supported, so attributes/data elements are always organised vertically with one field per row. Second, data entry is organised according to the design of the data model (i.e. attributes separately, forms split according to program stages).\n\nTracker data entry generally happens based on paper forms of two types:\n\n** Line lists, where each row represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n** Case/patient forms, where each form (e.g. A4 forms of one or more pages) represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n\nThis proposal is to support data entry interfaces for these two use cases.\n\nIn both cases, it should be possible to design the form/line list independent of whether fields are attributes, enrollment dates, event dates or data elements. It should be possible to use a single data entry field to represent multiple variables (for example, a “registration date” field could be used both as enrollment date and event date for a particular stage).\n\nThe line list functionality should be reviewed against the plans for editable working lists. However, unless the whole process (enrollment, multiple events etc) can be done, editable working lists do not elleviate the need for a line list interface.\n\n## The source of inputs\n\nNeed for line list/tabular data entry interface was discussed during C19, it is mention in [+capture app user stories+](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U72P63ZJW-5PuZBqYCSuO9lj95YLm8dQ4-kFznjVTn8/edit#gid=773129706), and there have been community apps that do this for events. This is primarily based on reflecting over and discussing the current situation in countries and how we support that. \n\n## The boundaries within which we should be analyzing (optional)\n\n----\n\nThe proposal is *not* about replacing the Capture app, which has much additional functionality beyond just data entry, but to complement it with more efficient and user-friendly ways of doing secondary data entry. Notably, since this is just about having a dedicated UI for data entry, implementations can combine or replace this with PoC data entry as they are ready; the underlying data model/configuration remains as today, and Capture can be used as today.",

However, it has been identified that this approach can lead to inaccurate figures in EMIS, as weekends and public holidays should ideally be excluded from the calculation. Especially when you are collecting daily attendance data. As a consequence completeness rate can never be 100% even though data has been collected all the school days. Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance",

Currently this can only be done on maintenance app & we can’t have all users accessing. \n\nCurrent workaround is screen for schools to populate profile and sharing share lists of schools opened and closed.\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nList any assumptions you have about your users, technical constraints, or business goals.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nWhat were the sources of input for this requirement\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nList the features discussed which are out of scope or might be revisited in a later release.\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

They are also useful when providing more clarity about the data visualisation without cluttering the screen.\n\nSee sample tooltip usage in a dashboard: [https://hearts360.org/](https://hearts360.org/)",

      "description": "## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nFor implementations in which the OU hierarchy opens and closes OU's constantly is difficult to work with the whole hierarchy, either for data entry or for the analytic apps. It would help having a tick to select the active org units, something like \"Show only active OUs\". This would hide the org units that are  currently closed (At the moment the user is using the system, not the reporting or selected period).\n\nFor analytics data displayed in results, would be enough to show data corresponding to the visible orgunits, independently from if any OU was opened during part of the selected periods. This is for day-to-day activities and users can work with the whole hierarchy if they want data from the past by not selecting this option.\n\nUser story:\n\nAs a **data analysis user**, I would like to be able to dinamically hide and show (toggle) closed org units in the analysis apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAs an **admin**, I would like to be able to hide closed org units in the data entry apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, some mechanism for archiving (e.g. excluding from analytics) could be handy (OUs could go from active to close to archive). \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAll data entry and analytics users in organizations that use an operational hierarchy. \n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nHaving an operational OU hierarchy instead of regional, OUs are opened and closed regularly (missions, projects, health sites, services…). As time passess by there are more and more closed (historic) org units. Normally there are more closed than open org. units. \nThey need to be kept in the hierarchy for retrospective analysis purpose, however for daily operations this becomes a barrier for user experience.\n\nCurrently, at admin level, we add the prefix “ZZZ_” to the closed OUs so that they appear at the end of the list.\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nAn org unit is considered to be closed when the current date is outside the opening date and the closed date of the org unit. Refer to the {{openingDate}} and {{closedDate}} properties.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nCommunity (MSF and other NGOs that use operational hierarchies)\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nNot defined at the moment.\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|Would it be enough to “hide empty rows?|No, for example to make a report by health facility.

However, as many partners work in the same areas (i.e., OUs) and with the same programs, this means that the data download for some partners is extreme, while for others it is simply one week’s worth of work. \n\nAs a **DHIS2 instance administrator**\n\nWhen using the Android Settings app\n\nI want to set the synchronization limit based on User group as opposed to OU and Program\n\nSo I can support different implementing partners with different capacities and ensure that their data capture and review on the mobile phone app is clear and practical for their capacity and purposes.*.*\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*Describe which users, countries, or use-cases face the problem, as well as how important the problem is to them.*\n\nAll implementing partners have different capacity in terms of the extent of their data capture, the access to reliable internet, and the capacity of their mobile phones (better quality, faster devices vs. cheaper lower spec devices). Because of the synchronization needs, some users are adversely affected by large data synchronizations while others need large synchronizations for their daily work. \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, we have synchronization settings by both OU and Program, but this still adversely affects some users. The only workaround would be to create sub-groups of implementing partners to split the data being synced. However, this does not help those data managers or users working across multiple OUs or programs. \n\n##",

This affects any instance, in any country. The problem is key to ensuring that data capture remains of high quality and that the individual performances of team members can be monitored. \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, data managers have to export data using the import/export app in CSV format to then determine what data was captured by each individual. This adds multiple layers of complexity and effort to team performance monitoring. It is clear that the data is being captured in the DHIS2 database already, it would simply be beneficial to have this available as a DE so that graphs and linelists can be created to monitor team performance.  \n\nBy being able to see who captured data (an event without registration or an event with registration) the data manager would be able to confirm whether the data capturer is capturing all the required data, whether it is being captured correctly and whether the data capturer is meeting performance targets. For example, a vaccinator is tasked to vaccinate 100 people per day. The data manager would then be able to create a graph or linelist of the data captured by that individual based on the DE. As the DE is automatically completed with the username of the data capturer, the timeliness of data capture is not affected with a field that is repeated for every record captured. \n\n##",

The following text elements are not affected by changing the language in the \"Systems setting\" app, the \"Users\" app, the language of the mobile device as well as saving translations in the \"Translation\" app.\n\nThe request is that the translations of the (missing) text elements saved in the respective field of the \"Translation\" affect the DHIS2-RTS when the language is set to the same language as the entered translations.\n\nThe following text elements are not available as translations and should be available in any DHIS2 language:\n\n**Home screen**\n\n**Header**\n\n**Drop-down menu with transaction types**\n\n**\"From\" drop-down menu**\n\n\"Search\" and \"Clear all\" in the header bar\n\n\"Cancel\" in the footer:\n\n**\"Deliver to\"**\n\n**\"Search\" window: applies to the home screen and all other user interfaces**\n\n**Home screen**\n\n\"Stock\"\n\n**Warning messages**\n\nThe message below is already available in English and French (thanks for that!) but also needed in other languages:\n\n**Steps for reproducing**\n\nThe behaviour can be studied in the DHIS2-RTS which is set to French and where French translations were entered for metadata in the \"Translations\" app. Complete reproduction would require configuring a complete DHIS2-RTS (which would take about two hours):\n\n** Configure a DHIS2-RTS Tracker Program as well as the \"Use-case\" app\n\n** Set language in the \"Settings\" app to French (for example)\n\n** Set language in the \"Users\" app to French (for example)\n\n** Change the language of the mobile device to French (for example)\n\n** Save translations for metadata for French (for example) in the \"Translations\" app\n\n** Log in to the Capture Android app on a mobile device\n\n** Synchronize the configuration\n\n** Open the DHIS2-RTS in the Capture app\n\n** Review the language of the text element\n\n**As a DHIS2-RTS user (storekeeper)**\n\n**When** - using the DHIS2-RTS app\n\n**I want to** - be able to select my native language (for example French, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic or Russian)\n\n**So I can** - manage my work in my native language.\n\n**Who faces this problem** and how important is it to them?\n\nParticularly users in francophone and Arabic speaking countries.\n\nDescribe which users, countries, or use-cases face the problem, as well as how important the problem is to them.\n\nThe request was specifically made by Syria\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?*\n\nUse the English user interface instead.",

However this case is very unlikely and therefore not part of the business requirements (as differentiation would require to also store the manufacturer name of every batch which would greatly complicate the system)\n\n** Batches are always managed and represented in the chronological order of their expiry dates (the user does not have the possibility to change the order in the interface) with the batch number with the shortest remaining shelf live (nearest expiry date) being displayed first\n\n** In the exceptional case of more than one batch number for the same item and the same expiry date, the system will display those items in the alphabetical order of their batch numbers\n\n** FEFO (first-expiry first-out) management by definition requires to deplete the entire stock of any batch before taking any quantity from the next batch\n\n** The system automatically \"hides\" any batches with a \"Stock\" of zero.\n\n** Different manufacturers use different conventions for expiry dates for example only indicating the month and year or the day, month and year and in various formats (without separation or dots or slashes as separators). However, these inconsistencies are not a concern for DHIS2-RTS as the expiry date has to be uploaded into the system and must be GS1 DataMatrix code compatible at that stage (regardless of the electronic data which is being loaded into DHIS2, any necessary conversions must be done by the national eLMIS system)\n\n** In alignment with current DHIS2 conventions, expiry dates are presented in the format YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY (all indicated as numbers) depending on the \"Calendar settings\" of the DHIS2 \"System Settings\" app\n\n** Batch number fields are alphanumeric (numbers and letters), may contain special characters such as blank spaces, hyphens, dots etc. and allow up to 20 characters\n\n** By default, the user interface displays only a list of items and the total quantities in stock but without any details of batch numbers and expiry dates (as this would lead to extensively long lists and users never need a complete list of all batches / expiry dates at the same time)\n\n** The user does not have the possibility of \"expanding\" the entire item list to show the batch numbers and expiry dates for all items (instead the user has to select a single item)\n\n** When the user selects any specific item (by search or by scanning) the sublist with the batch numbers and expiry dates is always displayed automatically (but always only for a single item at a time)\n\n** When the users scrolls down the list and taps on any item, this single item is displayed together with the sublist of batch numbers and expiry dates (in the same way as when an item is selected by searching or scanning)\n\n** Items without batches are displayed only as a single line (as in the overview list)\n\n** When the user has completed selecting the required quantities for each batch number and expiry date, the user selects a new button \"Select new item\" which takes her/him back to the item list for selecting the next item\n\n** Batches which have expired cannot be selected by the user\n\n**User interface for items selected by searching, tapping or scanning**\n\nThe batch number(s) and expiry date(s) are added to each item as a sublist in the following way (illustration is indicative and will be aligned to DHIS2 Android conventions):\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|81,000| |\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|23,000| |\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|4,000| |\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|13,000| |\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|8,000| |\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|33,000| |\n\n** the \"Stock\" in the header row (indicating the item) indicates the total quantity in stock (corresponding and always being identical with the sum of the quantities of every batch)\n\n** the \"Stock\" next to each of the batch numbers / expiry dates indicates the quantity on hand for each of the respective batches.\n\n**Work flow**\n\nThe entire logic of the workflow remains the same but there is a significant change in that the user must first select a single item before being able to enter any quantities This change is made to avoid the need for displaying an endlessly long list of all items and batches as well as for preventing user errors which are more likely if the batch numbers and expiry dates of many items are displayed in the same interface. This change also improves the user experience as the item description will always appear at the top of the list with ample place to display the batch numbers and expiry dates (only for this one specific item).\n\nThe other significant changes is that the user still enters the total required quantity but the system automatically calculates a suggestion for the quantities of each batch number and expiry date the user should pick according to FEFO (but allows the user to \"override\" the recommended selection which should be very exceptional).\n\n*The additional steps required in the workflow for the batch number and expiry date management are indicated in italics and in red*.\n\nUser:\n\n** receives a written request from departments, services or community health workers indicating a list of healthcare products and their quantities which are requested and need to be prepared by the pharmacy\n** starts the mobile device\n** open the DHIS2-RTS mobile app\n** selects the transaction type \"Distribution\" [\"Discard\" or \"Correction\"]\n** selects the \"Organisation Unit\" (name of the healthcare facility) if s/he has access to more than one\n** selects the ward/service etc. which is requesting the goods and for which the order picking is carried out\n** selects the first item by scrolling and tapping on the item, searching or using the barcode scanner\n** *as soon as any item is selected, the user interface displays a single item with the sublist of batches and expiry dates [new]*\n** *if the user made a mistake s/he can revert back to the item list at any time by selecting the \"back\" button (arrow) at the top left of the screen (any quantities entered are lost)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *are blocked from entering any \"Quantity\" for batches which are expired*\n** *the \"Review\" button is displayed at the bottom of the screen*\n** *if the quantity entered by the user exceeds the total available quantity, an error message is displayed, the user is blocked from proceeding and must reduce the quantity*\n** *system calculates the quantities of each batch (starting with the first FEFO batch) until the required quantity is reached and indicates the quantity calculated for each batch number and expiry date in the \"Quantity\" field*\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|21,000|60000|\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|0|23,000|\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|0|4,000|\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|0|13,000|\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|0|8,000|\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|21,000|12,000|\n\n** *has the possibility of altering those quantities (but only up to the total of each batch, the user is not able to select quantities which lead to negative stocks)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field of the requested batch*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *if the user changes the \"Quantity\" for any of the batch numbers, the total \"Quantity\" for the item will adjust to that change*\n** *selects \"Select next item\" button at the bottom right*\n** proceeds to search for or scan the next item\n** selects the \"Review\" button (on the user interface with the complete list of items)\n** system opens the \"Review\" interface and displays the \"Confirm\" button\n** system displays only the items with the total quantities which were selected\n** *if the user requires to review details at the batch number and expiry date level during the review s/he selects one item (at a time) by searching, tapping or scanning*\n** *system shows the item code of the selected item in the search window and one item with all the selected batch numbers and expiry dates with the selected quantities*\n** *reverts to the \"Review\" user interface by tapping on the \"x\" in the search window*\n** *system shows the \"Review\" user interface (only with items and the total quantities selected)*\n** selects the \"Confirm\" button\n** system reverts to the DHIS2-RTS home screen\n** informs the requester to pick up the goods are delivers them to the requesting department/service\n\n**Issues to be resolved**\n\n** Batches with a \"Stock\" of zero are not displayed by the system but if a mistake was made and the user needs to enter a \"Correction\" batch numbers and expiry dates with a \"Stock\" of zero need to be displayed in case stock is found to actually not be zero. Displaying all batches which ever where in stock is not practical. Perhaps the last five batch numbers and expiry dates which were \"emptied\" can be displayed only in the \"Correction\" user interface.\n\n** Should items with batch numbers but without expiry dates be managed by FIFO?\n\nxxx\n\nCorrection on 25.01.2024\n\n** Every Tracked Entity is specified by an item code (mandatory) and item description (mandatory)\n- Individual batch numbers / expiry dates are created by multiple “enrollments” of the same TEI (item) at the same OU. This has the advantage that in order to remove depleted batches (stock on hand = 0) individual enrollments can be “hidden” using the native “Completed” functionality.",

When configuring items to see in the data view via settings, there is no options for “registering unit”. I’ve noticed this is available for TEIs, but not for event programs. I know we can see registration units in line lists, or even click into the org unit hierarchy to see records associated with that unit, but I think it would still be useful to see the registering unit when viewing all events together.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\nCurrently, I work on a project that uses event programs in capture for 25 different districts and 5 provinces. Oftentimes, to do simple monitoring and checks, I’d rather see all events in a long list (including the registering unit), rather than clicking through each individual orgunit to see the events associated.\n\n### \n\n##",

For example, for calculating the number of items which are out of stock, the following indicator determines this for each Data element as \"1\" (stockout) and \"0\" (no stockout = stock is available) and then adds up the values for each Data element to a sum representing the total number of stockouts at an Organisation unit for any specific month:\n\nif(#{LNAkkMTxqEW.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{WyDZKSw82X6.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{JPccVwAGRq9.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{smxJz7Mt6ia.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{AaIApgGQM6t.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{vCTrmv52APd.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{SOw2TcuFFH2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RSIOx2u07Ln.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{JStiDyaPfqy.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{hZ1YvdcTDQM.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{tsi32D8HQd5.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{QWlPF8S0gCc.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{a5uLTDt12eT.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{U0AfOOyJMy2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cyf6UdScfFM.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{FeUTTNHpVzD.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{mKSICD1rxG4.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{mVNe1aS1pGl.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{oLAXTZY6ken.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{YYaRDUZyH9L.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{HVteopBt0jr.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{sWodd2tbjgZ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{yVYajDDYUfX.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{eTJAr4sc83v.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{U4KSmanl4JP.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{FXsa5uG3IGn.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{L34T9YDtCor.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{W5mHXhSYFfQ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cmSUyJOZwyl.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cT8sfosRXvU.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{OaWKnMS7say.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Z4bjHvGS6aH.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Nn1L7CNEtC8.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RNYKSc3nAUg.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{PtmZ9XqpPKi.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{CohlLHi54B0.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Gu6u82RD9OW.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{LiuYzxYr4Pt.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Tje33nJAG55.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{euM2dlqleYH.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{dASLmBTEehF.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{qU2LvzoPn1z.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{OkWaFxdUQY2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{YHIv7KQc2e7.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{rt9D47Inb49.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{i1iXbquZ5iv.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RcE30WBKrXI.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{EAG0GfdSMAs.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{N2aXs7VlJdJ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{xrjnOtFFTRC.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)\n\n**As a [DHIS2 user]**\n\nAs a DHIS2 (LMIS) user\n\n**when** - creating Indicators across many Data elments in a Data element group\n\n**I want to -** easily create the indicator by indicating the Data element group (instead of each Data element UID separately).

The global shell will ensure consistent headerbar and command pallet as well as other common global functionality such as alerts, session management, and more.\n\nOptional support for a global app shell has been released in DHIS2 v41.  By default, web applications are served independently.  However, an application with the name “global-app-shell” can be optionally installed and will subsequently be served instead of individual web applications.  All applications, both bundled and installed, will be harmonized and served from the {{/apps}} path, rather than for example {{/dhis-web-dashboard}} or {{/api/apps/my-app}}.  Accessing apps at their previous paths will redirect the user to the new location.\n\nAs a fallback, apps can be accessed directly at their old locations by appending the {{?redirect=false}} query paramenter.  For example, the app management app can be accessed directly from the browser at {{/dhis-web-app-management/index.html?redirect=false}} - this is useful for uninstalling a misbehaving global app shell, for example.",

The org unit hierarchies should be possible to create and manage in the maintenance apps.\n\n## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nBe able to maintain different OU hierarchies  within one instance to facilitate different Organisation structures. Some main uses of this would be to  support a public sector and private sector structure, a local country’s national hierarchy and an NGO operational hierarchy, managing multiple sectors within the same instance.\n\nuseful in order to have facilities and campaign programs in the same instance\n\nThis has been in high demand for malaria programs and campaign implementers, so that programs can have community-level org units like villages that do not fit well into the master org unit hierarchy\n\nWill be very useful in scenarios where a single ministry has multiple hierarchies\n\nAllow for support multiple ministries at government with different administrative structures\n\na lot of programs use additional implementation units that they need to be able to track indicators at (e.g. village, locality) that do not necessarily fit neatly into a hierarchical relationship with health facilities\n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nFor the **Sri Lankan** context, it's crucial to prioritize the implementation of support for multiple hierarchies with different administrative structures within our health sector.\n\n**Pakistan** want to combine public and private sector hierarchies \n\n**MSF** would like this to use both national/administrative hierarchy and MSF operational hierarchy\n\n**Ethiopia** needs this for its multi-sectoral district level M&E.

For example with the DHIS2 for education implementation in Uganda, we are working on departmental dashboards pulling data from one single tool - the termly tool. We would therefore like to have a dashboard label for Termly Tool data and then below have various tabs to navigate the different pages under there such as school health, school feeding etc. Example below:\n\nThis is how the dashboards currently are. We had to create individual dashboards for each of the departments which are pulling data from the same tool.\n\n \n\n \n\nThis here is what we suggest, is it possible for us to have a single dashboard but within there, one can have tabs through which a user can navigate to view the different categories of data.\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01 (1).png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01.png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!dashboard tabs (1).jpg|width=1640,height=924!\n\n!dashboard tabs.jpg|width=1640,height=924!",

Providing usage information will allow system owners to help pinpoint org units / users experiencing troubles; correlate usage rates to system expenditures (e.g. internet costs; hardware needs); identify specific areas (geographical and content) for future training; for measuring impact, with usage rates providing important context for further analysis. \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAs of 2.29, default analytics include only aggregate:\n\n** Favorite views\n** Favorites saved\n** Active users vs. Total users\n** Top favorites\n** Total data values saved\n\nProposed default analytic enhancements:\n\n** filtering by org unit\n** exposing org unit details when selected\n** Log on rates per program / per org unit based on data capture org unit assignment\n** Program stage completion rates\n** export of tables and visualization as both images and raw data\n** use of program rules to send notification to admin team based on configured inactivity rates per org unit (e.g. certain time with no log on; certain time with no updated data values)\n** Saving new analytics for use in Admin dashboard\n** Adding analytics to dashboards\n** Dashboard view counts \n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nSystem admins want to be able to monitor user activities to monitor completion of data entry tasks (programs and data entry), data use activities, and general app usage. \n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\n** End users give permission or admins have the authority to monitor DHIS2 usage. \n** Could result in complex log scraping and new data tables that could further hinder performance overall \n** Had to know how to measure “analytics usage”. It could be many thing that few directly translate to “data use”.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nMany large scale DHIS2 implementations \n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nTBD\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered*|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

      "description": "## Release Notes Description\n\n**New Capture Coordinates process:** The 3.1 version introduces a list of new features designed to enhance the capture coordinates process. These improvements aim to provide greater accuracy, flexibility, and control over location data capture.\n\n** **Accuracy:** The capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time. This parameter can also be restricted using the Android Settings WebApp.\n** **Search Functionality:** A new search functionality has been added, allowing users to look up specific locations by name or address. Users are also able to navigate through the map and perform area searches to discover other locations within a specified region.\n** **Block Manual Capture:** Using the Android Settings Web App, administrators now have the option to block manual location capture. When this setting is enabled, users can only capture the current location and cannot manually select or search a different one. This ensures that location data remains consistent and accurate.\n\n[+Jira+](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-6330) | [+Card1+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-disabled-manual-capture.png) | [+Card2+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-accuracy.png) | [+Card3+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-search.png) | [+Documentation+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*map*accuracy)\n\n## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nThe Android App needs to display the current accuracy in the coordinates selector when capturing current location. This provides a helpful prompt to recapture if the accuracy is low. Without this visual indicator, users capture very inaccurate coordinates without realizing. \n\nThis need applies to any coordinate capture using the mobile app - Enrollment, Event and data element coordinates.\n\nThis will provide much-needed accuracy to community-level data capturing. which will ensure improved quality of geo coordinate,s especially at the household level. overall, good accuracy improves quality of data entry at the community level.\n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nHelpful in urban and rural environments across multiple users and teams (EPI, bed nets, deliveries, entomology sentinel sites) and associated varied devices. Translates to cleaner map visuals for all MOH levels, partners, funders.\n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nWhen users are collecting coordinates with their mobile phone, the accuracy of the actual coordinates is not displayed in the user interface. However, GPS coordinates can be extremely inaccurate, but we know that accuracy improves with time or if the user captures coordinate 2-3 times. \n\nThe GPS feature currently is not trustworthy, and users need to confirm their GPS location as sometimes the signal is not very strong, resulting in inaccurate data capture. \n\nWihtout displaying accuracy information, it is very easy to just tap it and forget about whether the reading is accurate or not. Users are constantly capturing inaccurate GPS coordinates, simply because they are not getting visual feedback to re-capture. Displaying the accuracy will allow implementers to train users on leveraging this information to try capturing a few more times to let the accuracy increase .\n\nIn door to door data collection deliveries and sometimes the coordinates don't come as accurate as users don't have ideia of the accuracy then collecting the coordinates.\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nNot defined.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nThis issue comes from the community. \n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nNot defined\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered*|\n| | |Type // to add a date|",

In most cases, this information is not necessary to be included in analytics, and should not be exposed or exported from the system without the deliberate design choice to do so.\n\n|Role/domain - Functionality - Motivation|\n|As a system administrator, I want to be able to make sure that PII will not be available through the analytics apps / exportable / exposed through the API|\n|I still want to be able to exchange PII with other patient-based systems|\n|As a user administrator trying to limit the access to personally identifiable data, want to prevent non-clinical users from having access to attributes that are central for identification, so that as few people as possible have access to identifiable information.|\n|As a system administrator, I want the analytics process to consume as few resources as possible, so that the overall system performance is penalized as little as possible.|\n|I want to be able to see aggregations of the data (indicators) but not individual level data|\n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nPII appearing in linelists or included in data exports\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\n** System configurers already have options on tracked entity attributes that allow them to be excluded from search, or not shown in lists. Adding an additional choice to exclude the attribute to analytics would be intuitive and empower system designers to make better security choices.\n** There has already been implemented [+a flag/Boolean option called ‘skipAnalytics’ in the program stage data element model+](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-11720). A technical review should be done to see if this solution is sufficient enough for attributes as well. \n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\n[Non-analyzable attributes and data elements - Requirements Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PG*1dbKMFnZpb*Dsl1vyMIyXf6gAtYEGJ51skAkpapQ/edit#heading=h.wdit9bo4ao1b)\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nList the features discussed which are out of scope or might be revisited in a later release.\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

      "description": "## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nIndividuals and community members are active participants in their own health and the health of their communities.Empowering individuals to report on their own health data through mobile solutions enables more *robust data collection* and facilitates *task shifting* among the health workforce. Health workers’ time traditionally spent on data collection & reporting can be reallocated to improve data analysis and patient-centered care. Finally, self-reporting and feedback loops can expand the reach of health interventions and data systems to individuals who face barriers accessing health facilities. \n\nSelf monitoring implies that patients can access their own health record and consult and update their own health data. In some cases patinents will only need to see their data wihtout need to edit. \n\nThis use case is extended here> [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136) \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nPatients that are already registered in a health program.\n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nIn some cases / health programs patients are in really remote areas and having health staff monitoring them is not feasible, not even community health staff. Some programs requiere dayli upadtes and patients are requested to keep track of themselves and then, weekly or bi-weekley, when visited by a health worker they report all that information that is in many cases forgotten or not well recorded. Visits of this nature also take  alot of time.\n\nIn other cases, for example an epidemic, even if patinets are reachable, is simply not manageable to monitor them on daily basis, or not recommended for infectious risks. \n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nThe patient is already regitsered in the system.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nThis use case was already studied during covid. The source are many inputs from the community. \n\nReference douments from that study can be found here: \n\n** [Self reporting concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGMxHg*02UaJvpnPldRJ2uBBlK2UsyibPiwjXC*JGQg/edit#heading=h.midsb1pv3ak1)\n** [Self reporting user stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cB0YP*tS0ZL4wdaJQSN1wuDo*SLj6R9tO-LnaehBXiQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nSelf reporting could be addressed at different levels (see below). This Idea is refering to number 5. Self monitoring. The other use casesa re out of scope.\n\n1. Self assessment: mobile tools that enable an individual to make a self-assessment about whether he/she has COVID-10 symptoms\n1. Self reporting of aggregate/non-identifiable data: these user stories included mass surveys for individuals to report in whether or not they have COVID-19-like symptoms; only aggregate data are captured primarily for public health analytics purposes\n1. Self-identification: an individual is “unknown” to the health care system and make themself known through software (e.g. Tanzania hotline: individual calls hotline and phone number is pushed to DHIS2 event program through USSD solution for follow up\n1. Self-registration: an individual records their own details to ease the burden of the health workers on registration (e.g. a patient ‘self enrolls’ into a suspected COVID-19 case program\n1. Self-monitoring: an individual has had contact with the health system to be enrolled into some sort of longitudinal monitoring program, but they submit data themselves during the course of follow up period (e.g. an individual is registered into DHIS2 program by a CHW as a contact of a confirmed case and submit updates everyday for 14 days about whether or not they have developed symptoms)\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|How will patinets identify/authenticate themselves?| | |",

Some examples include looking up demographic information from an external client registry / looking up terminologies from a terminology service / etc.\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nThis request can already be solved on web only with tracker data entry plugins (v41) and the routes API (v40).  However, the request remains to solve this more generically through configuration (define an API lookup including query parameters and response mappings.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nPAHO, WHODrug, ICD-11, KS\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nExternal APIs will not work offline, so we will need to have some fallback\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",
