### [Improve end-user config error feedback [ROADMAP-296]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-296)

In some cases configuration errors leave empty screens in the Android Capture app, either because of empty forms or because of lack of access. From this version of the Android App the app will display explicit and understandable errors to the user, who will be able to effectively communicate with the administrator to fix the problem.

### [Import/export App DB  [ROADMAP-210]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-210)

As part of troubleshooting, some errors can be hard to replicate and can lead to data loss because of being unable to sync. With this functionality the end user will be able to export the local database and share it with an admin who will be able to import it for troubleshooting, being able to replicate the exact environment (database, device, configuration). The exported database is encrypted and the administrator will require the user credentials to be able to access the database.

As part of troubleshooting, some errors can be hard to replicate and can lead to data loss because of its nature and it would be easier to know what is the source by replicating in an exact environment (database, device, configuration).

**Expected behavior**

** Add an option in settings to export the database.
** Add an option in login to import a database.
**** Ask for permissions (user must provide the credentials to be able to import the DB)



### [Configurable basemap layer [ROADMAP-209]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-209)

DHIS2 supports the configuration of custom map layers for the Maps Web App. From this version of the DHIS2 Android App, those custom layers will be downloaded and rendered in the Maps. The custom layers will be presented as additional layers to the default ones.

In some countries where there are political disputes about borders having a single source of maps (in our case Mapbox) can present a political issue and countries not adopting the app due to this.

DHIS2 server allows administrators to define different maps sources or specific border definitions (include reference to this in the documentation) and the App should do the same to avoid these conflicts. Ideally, the App should read the configuration from the backend an adapt the maps displayed in it.

### [Improve app navigation performance for high number of TEIs  [ROADMAP-208]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-208)

Implementations are more and more demanding in terms of offline need of individual records. This version of the app has been reviewed to optimize performance when there are big numbers of TEIs downloaded locally.



### [Line listing analytics in Android [ROADMAP-206]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-206)

This version of the Android App includes the possibility to render and display line listing as part of the offline analytics functionalities. The line list has to be created using the Line Listing DHIS2 web App, and then configured to be displayed in Android using the Android Settings Web App (ASWA), as any other offline analytics in Android. In this case Line lists can be displayed in the home screen, and event or tracker programs (as they do not really apply to aggregated data, they are not displayed in Datasets). Users will be able to search by period, Org. unit, or any of the columns added in the Line List.

There are some limitations to the line lists to be displayed in the Android App. The Org. units and Periods must be relative, not fixed. And there is a maximum number of columns of 15.¬† Android Local Analytics are built using local data, and wil, update instantly as more data gets collected (or downloaded) in the device. The App will display a maximum of 500 rows and will inform the user when the limit is reached.

## üéØ¬†High Level use case 

In the context of a health facility stock control, any user of the mobile app should be able to view a complete record of all past transactions in order to replace the paper stock card with a digital stock card. When users have limited Internet connectivity the mobile app is intended to primarily be used off-line and users are expected to synchronize their local database with the server (only) about once a day.

In the context of a health program, listing people who need following up, e.g. defaulters, at the community level would allow for follow-ups when tracking services and monitoring patients. Particualry useful when dealing with data like TB, HIV etc

## :people*holding*hands: Users description

Community health worker, facility health worker, logisitican or person in change of warehouse and pharmacy stocks. 

‚ùì Problem Description

Currentrly there is no solution to display a list of cases or transactions that works in offline settings to be able to continue providing services and analyssing the data when internet is nto available for proplonged periods of time, 

ü§î¬†Assumptions

Not identified.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources

This is a request from LMIS is well documented in the linked Jira issue. 

Health program related use case comes from the community inputs. 

## (!)¬†Out of Scope

It is not possible to implement the complete functionality of the Linelisting web app. The features/limitations are 

** Max. 500 lines per table
** Max. 15 columns 
** There will be search/filter by column - including org. unit and event date

### [Embedded Superset Dashboards  [ROADMAP-317]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-317)

Many countries and organizations have their data spread out across multiple instances of DHIS2. Often, these instances are not synchronized in terms of metadata, which complicates integration and reporting. DHIS2 has not offered an easy way to present dashboards with data from multiple instances. This functionality implements support for embedding external Superset dashboards in our core dashboards app.

** **Allow selecting the user org unit in combination with other org units and/or org unit levels:** You can now combine org unit selections by selecting user org unit as well as other org units and org unit levels in all layer types.
** **Support custom calculations**: You can now utilize custom calculations created in Data Visualization app in Maps app.
**  **Additional information in pop-up for Tracked Entity Layers:** Pop-up now displays Coordinates, Org Unit name and attributes if marked to be displayed in list (similarly to Event layer pop-ups).
** **Enhanced support for type of relationships in Tracked Entity layer:** Experimental relationships mapping now supports a broader variety of relationships definitions: unidirectional and bidirectional relationships and permutations of: same TrackedEntity type and same program (or program not specified), same TrackedEntity type but different program (or one program not specified) or different TrackedEntity types.

** All Maps now handle multiple periods selections, including mixed selections of different period types, fixed and/or relative presets.
** Start and End Date inputs use the new standard calendar with improved data entry mask, which supports translations (currently limited to the Gregorian calendar).
** Mapping options (Single, Timeline, or Split Map) are now more clearly displayed with icons and improved information messages.

### ["Days after period to qualify for timely submission" and "Expiry days" supports number type values [ROADMAP-344]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-344)

When specifying the parameters for a data set, you can now use numbers (eg 0.5) for the "Days after period to qualify for timely submission" and ‚ÄúExpiry days‚Äù.

Willl meet usecase like eg In Sierra Leone, timely submission for weekly IDSR data is Monday at 12 (noon), which is 0.5 days after period end on Sunday midnight.

With DHIS2 increasingly being used for IDSR where rapid reporting etc are a must, this change will increasingly be used to set timeliness requirements less than one day, or in some cases e.g. 1.5 days.  Historically this parameter has been mostly used for timeliness of "long transaction" monthly aggregated data (the term "long transaction" is a term used for data processes that take considerable time - in the DHIS2 case typically 5-20 days after the end of the month). Disease surveillance data is different, because rapid submission of e.g. outbreak data is of vital importance for the early containment of epidemics. Such data is also increasingly being submitted directly from health facilities or clinicians, using browsers or the Android Capture app.

As part of troubleshooting, some errors can be hard to replicate and can lead to data loss because of being unable to sync. With this functionality the end user will be able to export the local database and share it with an admin who will be able to import it for troubleshooting, being able to replicate the exact environment (database, device, configuration). The exported database is encrypted and the administrator will require the user credentials to be able to access the database.

As part of troubleshooting, some errors can be hard to replicate and can lead to data loss because of its nature and it would be easier to know what is the source by replicating in an exact environment (database, device, configuration).

**Expected behavior**

** Add an option in settings to export the database.
** Add an option in login to import a database.
**** Ask for permissions (user must provide the credentials to be able to import the DB)



### [Configurable basemap layer [ROADMAP-209]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-209)

DHIS2 supports the configuration of custom map layers for the Maps Web App. From this version of the DHIS2 Android App, those custom layers will be downloaded and rendered in the Maps. The custom layers will be presented as additional layers to the default ones.

In some countries where there are political disputes about borders having a single source of maps (in our case Mapbox) can present a political issue and countries not adopting the app due to this.

DHIS2 server allows administrators to define different maps sources or specific border definitions (include reference to this in the documentation) and the App should do the same to avoid these conflicts. Ideally, the App should read the configuration from the backend an adapt the maps displayed in it.

[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#map-layers) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-209-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-209-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-209-Image02.png)



### [Improve app navigation performance for high number of TEIs  [ROADMAP-208]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-208)

Implementations are more and more demanding in terms of offline need of individual records. This version of the app has been reviewed to optimize performance when there are big numbers of TEIs downloaded locally.



### [Custom icons [ROADMAP-207]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-207)

DHIS2 2 now supports uploading custom Icons to be used in addition to the built in Icon library. This is useful for use cases not related to health or that require very specific iconography. The Android App will render the custom icons that need to be uploaded and configured using the Maintenance DHIS2 Web App.

[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/visual-configurations.html#capture*app*visual*icon*lib) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-207-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-207-Image01.png)



### [Improve TEI dashboard user experience [ROADMAP-205]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-205)

In the previous version of the application, the TEI header part of the dashboard was improved. In continuation to that effort, the bottom part, where all program stages are displayed, has been redesigned in this version. The changes include are fresh and more clean look of the list of events, with more space and less -not critical- information displayed. In addition, the button for creating new events has been moved to the top (in timeline view).

[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.htm#capture*app*programs*TEI*Dashboard*program*stages)

**Proposed improvements**

**Timeline**

** When the timeline has more than 5 events, a ‚ÄúShow X more...‚Äù button with X = number of hidden events will be displayed.
**** When displaying all the events the Show more button will change to ‚ÄúShow less...‚Äù
** Remove the ‚Äúlast updated‚Äù from card

**Grouped**

** Program stages without events display the label ‚Äúno data‚Äù
** Program stages are always open (not collapsible as it was before)
** When a program stage has more than 3 events, a ‚ÄúShow X more...‚Äù button with X = number of hidden events will be displayed.
**** When displaying all the events the Show more button will change to ‚ÄúShow less...‚Äù
** Remove the ‚Äúlast updated‚Äù from card

### [Improvements in forms layout [ROADMAP-204]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-204)

When creating an event or an enrollment, there are a number of fields that are not data elements or attributes, for example, event date, org unit, coordinates, enrollment date, category combinations. Those elements are referred to as event/enrollment details and in previous versions they were displayed in different screens separated from the data elements or attributes. They were difficult to find when users wanted to edit or consult them. In this version the details are displayed inside the form, as the first opened section for completion. Once they are filled in, for example when the user reopens the event or enrollment form, the details section will be visible and easily available, but collapsed to leave more space for the data collection.¬†

### [Improve TEI search user experience [ROADMAP-203]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-203)

The search form has been improved to provide a cleaner look and a more intuitive user experience. The buttons have been made more explicit for differencing search from creation. In addition the flow for searching TEIs using attributes rendered as bar / QR codes has been made more agile. If there is only one result and the attribute is unique, the app will open the TEI Dashboard directly. If there are multiple results, the app will display all the cards on the TEI list (this is equal to the current workflow), and if there are no results, the app will display the create button and allow the user to ‚Äúsearch outside the program‚Äù if the configuration allows it.

[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*unique*qrBar_search) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-203-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-203-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-202-Image02.png)

**Reduce steps in QR code/Bar code search workflow**

Improve the user experience when users search for a TEI using a UNIQUE QR/bar code. Currenrtly, when there are exact matches, the app displays the card or cards on the list.

The proposed behaviour is:

After searching by QR code/Barcode:

** If there is only one result, the app opens the TEI Dashboard.
** If there are multiple results, the app will display all the cards on the TEI list (current workflow)
- If there are no results, the app will display the create button  and allow the user to ‚Äúsearch outside the program‚Äù (if the config allows it)



### [Support for customized tracker terminology v1 [ROADMAP-201]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-201)

Some DHIS2 terminology is not familiar for the end users. For this reason, we are gradually enabling the possibility to customize it to each particular use case. In this version, the term "event" and "enrollment" are customizable. The admin user will be able to configure it for each program using the Maintenance App, and the Android Capture App will display the customized term instead of the generic one.

[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*customized*terminology)  | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image02.png) | [3](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image03.png) | [4](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image04.png)

Support the posibility to configure certain tracker terminology to provide a more contextualized user experience. For 2.10 we will aim for: 

** Enrollment (25 strings)
** Event
** Program Stage ()

Future version will include

** Registering unit
** Follow-up
** Attribute
** Relationships
** Notes

## üéØ¬†High Level use case 

Multi selection option sets in the Capture app

## :people*holding_hands: Users description

Data entry: there are many types of structured data where the most accurate response is ‚Äúselect all that apply‚Äù

System Configurer: The only way to work around multiselect currently is create complex program rules and redundant fields that reduce form performance, introduce complications, and reduce data quality

## ‚ùì Problem Description

The absence of multiselect

## üéØ¬†High Level use case 

Multi selection option sets in the Capture app

## :people*holding_hands: Users description

Data entry: there are many types of structured data where the most accurate response is ‚Äúselect all that apply‚Äù

System Configurer: The only way to work around multiselect currently is create complex program rules and redundant fields that reduce form performance, introduce complications, and reduce data quality

## ‚ùì Problem Description

The absence of multiselect

## ü§î¬†Assumptions

Such dissagregation will facilitate analysisng Program Indicators by those disaggregation witih the analytics apps as well as aggregating the values and importing within an aggregated data model thourgh the exchange app (in the same or different instance).

Documentation | Feature card | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3

## 

üéØ¬†High Level use case 

Support bucketed program indicator outputs, mapping to category option combinations so that a single Program indicator can be converted to multiple aggregate data element values without having to create a program indicator for each permutation.

## :people*holding*hands: Users description

Crosses a large range of users that use program indicators  This is an important LMIS issue. 

## ‚ùì Problem Description

Reduce redundancy in PIs usage as currently you have to re-create multiple PIs to meet the required disaggregations

it is getting difficult to maintain thousands of program indicators with one change affecting all copies of the same indicator with different age and gender disaggregations

This could help support tracker to aggregate integration without creating massive amounts of metadata.

This is an important LMIS issue. The DHIS2-RTS Tracker Program allows recording "Distribution" for 17 different "Deliver to" (surgical ward, operating theatre etc.), total "Deliver" as well as "Receipt", "Discard" and "Correction" for, say 300 different health care products (TEIs). In order to provide daily and monthly aggregates we therefore need 22 x 300 = 6,600 Program Indicators (and 6,600 Predictors for the "daily" and an additional 6,600 Predictors for the "monthly" report in an "aggregate" Data entry form).

### [Metadata deduplication and merging [ROADMAP-39]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-39)

Merging of metadata is being gradually supported within DHIS2 core funcitonalities facilitating metadata cleanup operations. Backend supports merging the following metadata objetcs through the web API: Organisation Units, Data Eelements, Indicators, Indicator Types, Category options, Categories, Category Combinations, Category option combinations (limited to one use case, when the catoptcombination are the same).  Frontend support through the user interface is gradually implemented as well. So far the new Maintenance app supports meging options for Category option and Category option comninations, Indicators and Indicator types. In these cases the user is able to select the ‚Äúsource‚Äù object to merge and the ‚Äútarget‚Äù object to merge into.

### [Email-based authentication codes for multi-factor authentication [ROADMAP-234]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-234)

From this version, DHIS2 also support email-based multi factor authentication (MFA). Email-based MFA should be configured at the system level and will be an option for the users when they are turning on MFA/2FA. If the user selects "Email", they system emails a one-time password to the provided email address.

Documentation | Feature card | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3

## 
üéØ¬†High Level use case 

It is likely that many of our less computer savvy users will not be able to set up and maintain a software based OTP solution such as google authenticator.

## :people*holding*hands: Users description

HISP SA require this flexibility on MFA type to support their compliance with ISO +27001+

## ‚ùì Problem Description

Please enable email based OTPs and when the user is turning on MFA/2FA for their account they are asked:

{quote}**How do you want to authenticate?**{quote}

** Authenticator app
** Email

If the user selects "Email", they system emails a one-time password to the email address on file and then states:

{quote}A two factor authentication code has been sent to **[email address]**.{quote}

### [Export idScheme [ROADMAP-351]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-351)

The IdScheme support in the old tracker endpoints and the new Tracker endpoints have been aligned. Until now, New Tracker endpoints only supported importing tracker data with different idSchemes, but not when exporting. Exporting with different idSchemes is supported now.

The query parameters implemented are idScheme, categoryOptionComboIdScheme, categoryOptionIdScheme, dataElementIdScheme, orgUnitIdScheme, programIdScheme, programStageIdScheme. And valid values are one of UID, CODE, NAME, ATTRIBUTE:{uid}. 

The default is UID. All (supported) metadata is exported using the {{idScheme}} value unless it is overridden by one of the metadata-specific parameters. There might be metadata that is always exported using UIDs. Please check the individual endpoint issues/docs for specifics.

Support of different idSchemes is added to {{/tracker/trackedEntities}} and {{/tracker/events}} endpoints.

### [Embedded Superset Dashboards  [ROADMAP-317]](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-317)

Many countries and organizations have their data spread out across multiple instances of DHIS2. Often, these instances are not synchronized in terms of metadata, which complicates integration and reporting. DHIS2 has not offered an easy way to present dashboards with data from multiple instances.
