# 2.38 Upgrade Notes

## Database

## API

- Running jobs manually using `/api/jobConfigurations/execute` changed from 
  `GET` to `POST` request
- Program id is now mandatory for program stage. Affected endpoints: /programStages, /metadata
- Several API endpoints slightly change their response root object to be in line 
  with the majority of endpoints.
  The root object returned pre 2.38 will become the member named `response`
  of the new root object returned by 2.38. Consumers can opt to either use
  `/api/37/...` to get the old behaviour or have to unpack to new response
  by doing `<root>.response` to resolve the previous root from the 2.38 
  response.
 
  **OBS!** In case of error responses this also entails an HTTP status code 
  change from `200 OK` to `409 Conflict`.
  
  Affected endpoints are:

  - `POST /api/completeDataSetRegistrations` with `JSON`/`XML` (only non 
   `async` affected)
  - `POST /api/dataValueSets` with `JSON`/`XML`/`ADX`/`CSV` (only non `async` affected)
  - `POST /api/metadata` with `JSON`/`XML`/`GML`/`CSV` (only non `async` affected)
  - `POST /api/predictions` (only non `async` affected)
  - `PUT /api/predictions` (only non `async` affected)
  - `PUT /api/relationships/{id}`
  - `PUT /api/users/{uid}` with `JSON`/`XML`
