I suggest that more filters be created so that users can select specific years, specific data sets, and also the organization units. This way, someone can easily generate analytic tables, for instance, for their planned training, without waiting 26 hours for the analytics to run. Very frustrating.*\n\n##",

This will support IDSR use cases where timely submission for weekly IDSR data is Monday at 12 (noon), which is 0.5 days after period end on Sunday midnight.\n\nWith DHIS2 increasingly being used for IDSR where rapid reporting etc are a must, this change will increasingly be used to set timeliness requirements less than one day, or in some cases e.g. 1.5 days.  Historically this parameter has been mostly used for timeliness of \"long transaction\" monthly aggregated data (the term \"long transaction\" is a term used for data processes that take considerable time - in the DHIS2 case typically 5-20 days after the end of the month). Disease surveillance data is different, because rapid submission of e.g. outbreak data is of vital importance for the early containment of epidemics. Such data is also increasingly being submitted directly from health facilities or clinicians, using browsers or the Android Capture app.\n\nDocumentation | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/42/42-collect-timely-submission.png) | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3",

      "description": "When creating a map, chart or table I want to know what periods are relevant for the selected data item.\n\nThis might be more of an observation than a bug, but it’s not easy to understand why sometimes there is data, and other times there is not.\nThis seems to be related to choosing relative periods (for example last 14 days) when the data set is capturing monthly data. This is also confusing when selecting fixed periods, 1.12.2024 to 31.12.2024 and seeing data for the month, but when selecting a period that does not cover first to last day of the month, data is not shown. \n\nAnother example of confusion is, if I select the 1st until the 30th of November 2024, data shows up, but if I select a relative period of the last 60 days (which includes the whole November 2024), no data is shown.\n\nI’m guessing there’s a reasonable explanation for that, but as a first time user of the Map app, it’s hard to figure out why.",

      "description": "**Component**: Android App\n**Type**: New Feature\n**Description**:\nIn the DHIS2 web version, the **Reports** > **Resource** feature allows us to store useful documents and links, which can then be embedded in dashboards for users to access. For example, in one of our dashboards, we provide links to various tutorials and user guides to help users better navigate and utilize DHIS2. These links lead to external resources, such as training material hosted on other platforms.\nWe would like to request the integration of a similar feature into the DHIS2 Android app. This would enable app users to access documentation, tutorials, or short videos directly from their mobile devices. The goal is to provide the same level of support and training resources for mobile users as we currently do for web users.\n**Proposed Features:**\n\n** **Resource Repository:** A section in the Android app where documentation, links, or videos can be attached and accessed.\n** **Dashboard Integration:** The ability to display and link these resources from within dashboards in the app.\n** **Offline Access :** An option to download specific resources for offline use.\nImpact:\nThis feature would greatly enhance user experience and ensure that DHIS2 app users have the necessary support and training resources at their fingaertips, fostering better adoption and utilization of the platform.\n**Steps to Reproduce (current behavior):**\n** Navigate to the DHIS2 web version.\n** Go to **Reports** > **Resource** and store links/documents.\n** Observe that these resources are not accessible from the Android app.\nThank you for considering this feature request!",

It’s especially important for large organizations or country implementations where there are numerous dashboards for different programs, projects, or regions. These users need efficient dashboard organization to enhance usability, improve workflow efficiency, and reduce the cognitive load of finding the right dashboards for specific tasks.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users work around this limitation by using naming conventions to group dashboards or manually scrolling through the dashboard list to locate the relevant one. This can be time-consuming, especially in implementations with a high volume of dashboards. Additionally, users may rely on keeping lists of dashboard names, but these approaches are neither efficient nor scalable in environments with complex dashboard structures.",

This feature is required if the either DHIS2 is not integrated with an upstream, national eLMIS which therefore cannot automatically calculate replenishment orders using the VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory) concept or if stakeholders refuse to use VMI for stock replenishment and want the healthcare facilities to decide on stock replenishment orders.\n\nThe required calculation is in principle simple:\n\nAverage distributions of the past 90 days, multiplied with a fixed factor (for example 3) from which then the stock on hand is subtracted.\n\nThe distribution quantities of each transaction are recorded in DHIS2-RTS as a separate event and a quantity in the \"Distribution\" Data element (Tracker data element).\n\nThe stock on hand is also available in the DHIS2-RTS as another Data element (Last value)\n\nThe functionality which is missing and required is allowing the user to:\n\n** use a Program indicator in a program rule, or\n\n** configure a new d2: function which allows aggregating the Data element values of a Tracker program event across a defined period (for example the last 90 days)\n\n**As a DHIS2 user**, storekeeper in a healthcare facility using DHIS2-RTS for recording transactions.\n\n**When** - prepare the (monthly) stock replenishment order\n\n**I want to** - review an automated calculation in DHIS2-RTS\n\n**So I can** - order according to a sound, systematic and rational inventory control policy\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAny storekeeper who needs to place a (monthly) order using the DHIS2-RTS application\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nManual calculation on paper, with a calculator or a spreadsheet.",

Storekeepers select the items they want to order one by one and then enter the order quantity. Healthcare facilities need to purchase all goods from the central medical store and have limited budgets. Therefore they would like to calculate the value of their orders “on the fly”. This calculation is possible with a Program indicator but requires saving the Event, then moving to the analytics screen, checking the total value and then moving back to the main Event program screen.\n\n!image-20240926-153301.png|width=361,height=743,alt=\"image-20240926-153301.png\"!\n\n**As a storekeeper (DHIS2 user)**\n\n**When** – placing an order in the dedicated Event program\n\n**I want to** – view the updated total cost of my order on the Event home screen\n\n**So I can** – adjust the ordered items and quantities without having to switch between UIs.\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAll users of 90 healthcare facilities in the Comoros whenever they place their orders, usually two to three times per month.\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nUsers calculate the order value manually with a calculator.",

Every storekeeper must use the most recent stock on hand data from the storekeeper on the previous shift or who worked on the previous day. However, currently the Capture Android app data is cached by user/instance/device which means that every storekeeper would be using the stock data from their previous shift, even if it was days or even weeks ago (in case of sick leave or holidays). This means that any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between two logins of a certain user, will always be wrong for every user. Two work arounds are available but are both not ideal for different reasons.\n\n**As a DHIS2 administrator**\n\n**When** – implementing DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management tool) anywhere\n\n**I want to** – force mobile devices to synchronise (only) the DHIS2-RTS Tracker program during login and logout\n\n**So the next user –** will use the correct and most recent stock position (of the user which was previously logged in) and not the stock position of the user who is logging in. This user might have logged in the last time days ago (or even weeks ago in case of sick leave or holidays) and the cached stock position will be completely outdated.\n\n**Who faces the problem**\n\nThis problem was encountered during the current DHIS2-RTS implementation (September 2024) in the Comoros but all DHIS2-RTS implementations are affected.\n\nAll users are affected by this problem and if there is more than one user using the same mobile device, the stock position will always be wrong for all users. To be precise: any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between the login of a certain user, will be wrong.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nThe problem can be avoided by ensuring that all users synchronises the mobile device right after logging in and right before logging out. However, sooner or later a user will forget. Morever, the Internet connection is not always available and if a user cannot synchronise data before going home, s/he will not wait for the Internet to return.\n\nThe current solution is to simply ask all users to use the same credentials which is not ideal from a security point of view.\n\n**Proposed feature**\n\nThe DHIS2 Administrator has the option of “forcing” the synchronisation for a specific Program after login and during logout in the Android-settings app which gives users a choice.",

This approach would help maintain focus on each question, reduce cognitive load, and ensure that data collectors can complete the forms efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Use Case:** **Expected Behavior:**\n\n** **Single-Question Display:** When a data entry form is opened in the Android app, only one question should be displayed at a time.\n** **Swipe Navigation:** Data collectors should be able to swipe left or right to move to the next or previous question, respectively.\n** **Progress Indicator:** A progress bar or a question number indicator at the top or bottom of the screen would help users track their progress through the form.\n** **Data Validation:** As each question is answered, the app should validate the input before allowing the user to proceed to the next question. If there is an error, an appropriate message should be displayed.\n** **Review Mode:* After completing all the questions, data collectors should have the option to review their answers before final submission, either by swiping through the questions again or by viewing a summary screen.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*This is faced by the DHIS2 Android Capture users (field workers).*\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*There’s not currently a way round this in DHIS2*\n\nThis feature would greatly enhance the data collection process, particularly in scenarios where attention to detail is critical. I believe it would be a valuable addition to the DHIS2 Android app and would be appreciated by many users in the field.",

We should be able to state in our analysis that our data is not available/not accessible/not reliable enough and have the validation rules checking that an action was done for each data elements: either a number/answer should appear, or the box should be clicked. When looking at the analytics, that would give the users/epidemiologists the information on how reliable the visualization is (e.g. 20% of entry were done for this data element).\n\n**How would it look like?**\n\nWe should be able to configure this functionality for each data elements of the data entry app:   Option of having a tick box which would grey and disable the data entry instead of leaving the box empty.\n\n**Who faces this problem and how important it is to them?**\n\nAll the ICRC users are facing this problem today. We have moved from a Lotus Note application to DHIS2 and this function was very important for the health data analysis when looking at the aggregation of data / analytics. We do work with partners in our operations, and we do collect data from them, and we therefore need to be able to assess if the data that we have is not reliable. This is part of our analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis feature would be a valuable enhancement that will greatly benefit users, particularly within the ICRC, by making the data entry more reliable and the analysis more efficient.",

      "description": "**Description:**\n\nWe propose the addition of wild card search and best match functionality within the DHIS2 Data Entry app to improve the efficiency and user experience of searching for organization units.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe current search functionality in the DHIS2 Data Entry/ Data visualizer app does not support wild card searches or best match results, which can hinder users' ability to quickly and accurately find specific organization units. Implementing these features will streamline the search process, reducing the time and effort required for data entry.\n\n1. Key Benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced User Experience:\n#** Users will be able to perform more flexible and intuitive searches, increasing satisfaction and productivity.\n1. Improved Efficiency:\n#** The ability to use wild card searches and view best match results will reduce the time spent searching for organization units, allowing users to complete data entry tasks more quickly.\n1. Greater Accuracy:\n#** Best match functionality will help users find the most relevant organization units, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n1. Scope and Requirements:\n\n1. Wild Card Search:\n#** Implement wild card search capabilities to allow partial matches. For example, searching for \"Hosp**\" should return all organization units that start with \"Hosp\".\n1. Best Match Results:\n#** Introduce an algorithm to rank search results based on relevance, displaying the best matches at the top of the list.\n1. User Interface Adjustments:\n#** Modify the search interface to accommodate and display these new search features clearly.\n\n1. ICRC Specific Needs:\n\n** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) manages a large number of organization units. This vast hierarchy makes it challenging for users, especially those at higher levels, to find specific facilities quickly.\n** Variations in language and the use of accents or special characters can lead to inconsistencies in the names of organization units, further complicating the search process. For example, a facility's name might differ slightly depending on the language or presence of accented characters, making it difficult to locate using the current search functionality.\n** Implementing wild card searches and best match results will greatly assist our users by accommodating these variations and improving the accuracy and speed of their searches.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWhile the initial implementation may require adjustments in the backend search algorithms and interface design, the long-term benefits in terms of improved search efficiency and user satisfaction are significant. This feature will also position DHIS2 as a more user-friendly platform, potentially attracting more users and use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe believe that adding wild card search and best match functionality to the DHIS2 Data Entry app is a valuable enhancement that will greatly benefit users, particularly within the ICRC, by making the search process more efficient and accurate. We request that this feature be considered for inclusion in the DHIS2 roadmap.",

This is especially so when working with program indicators, where there is no tracker/event data at all, the cell is left as a blank rather than have a zero. I would like to have the option of assigning this blank/null cell a color when creating the legend.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nWhen creating a legend, a user should be able to assign a color for null values as well (just like in maps). This way, if a user creates a pivot table and assigns it this legend, the cells which are blank/null will have the assigned color.",

For example, the “priority” column could be taken out, and the report be grouped by section of high, medium, low, validation rules that could be expanded/collapsed by priority; and that would save the width of one column right away.) \n\n!image-20240612-114442.png|width=100%,alt=\"image-20240612-114442.png\"!\n\n*The curent validation rule analysis screen* missing *these key features.*\n\nThese new features are:\n\n** Instruction: this property is where we should be inputting the action a user should be taking (based on how it is used in the data entry app also) - in this report it would serve two purposes which are crucial. 1. It would help a user understand why the validation is showing in the first place (the name may not do that, which is in the table, so this is helpful extra context to help them know why the problem matters.) 2. It tells them what action should then be taken. \n** A link back to the data entry screen where rectification can then be taken to fix the value.\n**** If there is concern that a user with authority to run a validation analysis shouldn’t also be changing data - I’d suggest a toggle-able feature based upon the user authority for also being able to enter data.\n\nThank you - I think these two additions would be valuable.

The wide use of custom forms for aggregate data sets indicate that replicating the format/structure of the source document is the preferred way to do data entry from paper forms.\n\nThe current Capture app does not support this. First, custom forms are not supported, so attributes/data elements are always organised vertically with one field per row. Second, data entry is organised according to the design of the data model (i.e. attributes separately, forms split according to program stages).\n\nTracker data entry generally happens based on paper forms of two types:\n\n** Line lists, where each row represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n** Case/patient forms, where each form (e.g. A4 forms of one or more pages) represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n\nThis proposal is to support data entry interfaces for these two use cases.\n\nIn both cases, it should be possible to design the form/line list independent of whether fields are attributes, enrollment dates, event dates or data elements. It should be possible to use a single data entry field to represent multiple variables (for example, a “registration date” field could be used both as enrollment date and event date for a particular stage).\n\nThe line list functionality should be reviewed against the plans for editable working lists. However, unless the whole process (enrollment, multiple events etc) can be done, editable working lists do not elleviate the need for a line list interface.\n\n## The source of inputs\n\nNeed for line list/tabular data entry interface was discussed during C19, it is mention in [+capture app user stories+](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U72P63ZJW-5PuZBqYCSuO9lj95YLm8dQ4-kFznjVTn8/edit#gid=773129706), and there have been community apps that do this for events. This is primarily based on reflecting over and discussing the current situation in countries and how we support that. \n\n## The boundaries within which we should be analyzing (optional)\n\n----\n\nThe proposal is *not* about replacing the Capture app, which has much additional functionality beyond just data entry, but to complement it with more efficient and user-friendly ways of doing secondary data entry. Notably, since this is just about having a dedicated UI for data entry, implementations can combine or replace this with PoC data entry as they are ready; the underlying data model/configuration remains as today, and Capture can be used as today.",

Core applicationss that will use this component will need advanced functionality.\n\nCommon functionality is required in many core applications. The component can have an opinionated, consistent interface to offer this common functionality. Precomposing the component means that the interface and interaction patterns will remain consistent for users. The use-cases are few and focused enough that an inflexible composed component will be a feature, rather than a bug. Edge cases can still be handled by composing a custom component.",

      "description": "## 💭 Problem definition\n\nCurrently, DHIS2 calculates completion rates taking into account all days, including weekends and public holidays. However, it has been identified that this approach can lead to inaccurate figures in EMIS, as weekends and public holidays should ideally be excluded from the calculation. Especially when you are collecting daily attendance data. As a consequence completeness rate can never be 100% even though data has been collected all the school days. Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance",

Data approvals are designed so that attribute option combinations are approved for all the data sets belonging to a data approval workflow.

      "description": "## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nFor implementations in which the OU hierarchy opens and closes OU's constantly is difficult to work with the whole hierarchy, either for data entry or for the analytic apps. It would help having a tick to select the active org units, something like \"Show only active OUs\". This would hide the org units that are  currently closed (At the moment the user is using the system, not the reporting or selected period).\n\nFor analytics data displayed in results, would be enough to show data corresponding to the visible orgunits, independently from if any OU was opened during part of the selected periods. This is for day-to-day activities and users can work with the whole hierarchy if they want data from the past by not selecting this option.\n\nUser story:\n\nAs a **data analysis user**, I would like to be able to dinamically hide and show (toggle) closed org units in the analysis apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAs an **admin**, I would like to be able to hide closed org units in the data entry apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, some mechanism for archiving (e.g. excluding from analytics) could be handy (OUs could go from active to close to archive). \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAll data entry and analytics users in organizations that use an operational hierarchy. \n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nHaving an operational OU hierarchy instead of regional, OUs are opened and closed regularly (missions, projects, health sites, services…). As time passess by there are more and more closed (historic) org units. Normally there are more closed than open org. units. \nThey need to be kept in the hierarchy for retrospective analysis purpose, however for daily operations this becomes a barrier for user experience.\n\nCurrently, at admin level, we add the prefix “ZZZ_” to the closed OUs so that they appear at the end of the list.\n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nAn org unit is considered to be closed when the current date is outside the opening date and the closed date of the org unit. Refer to the {{openingDate}} and {{closedDate}} properties.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nCommunity (MSF and other NGOs that use operational hierarchies)\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nNot defined at the moment.\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|Would it be enough to “hide empty rows?|No, for example to make a report by health facility. You want to see the data for all facilities even if null values because you looking for completeness of data therefore cannot tick hide empty rows but now all closed organisation units also appear in the report.|Type // to add a date|\n|Would this improve analytics performance?| |Type // to add a date|",

The mobile phone app allows for previously captured records to be synced and available for editing but this number is limited based on the global Android App settings - the limitation is by OU or by Program (or a combination of the two). However, as many partners work in the same areas (i.e., OUs) and with the same programs, this means that the data download for some partners is extreme, while for others it is simply one week’s worth of work. \n\nAs a **DHIS2 instance administrator**\n\nWhen using the Android Settings app\n\nI want to set the synchronization limit based on User group as opposed to OU and Program\n\nSo I can support different implementing partners with different capacities and ensure that their data capture and review on the mobile phone app is clear and practical for their capacity and purposes.*.*\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*Describe which users, countries, or use-cases face the problem, as well as how important the problem is to them.*\n\nAll implementing partners have different capacity in terms of the extent of their data capture, the access to reliable internet, and the capacity of their mobile phones (better quality, faster devices vs. cheaper lower spec devices).

The only workaround would be to create sub-groups of implementing partners to split the data being synced.

The problem is key to ensuring that data capture remains of high quality and that the individual performances of team members can be monitored. \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, data managers have to export data using the import/export app in CSV format to then determine what data was captured by each individual. This adds multiple layers of complexity and effort to team performance monitoring. It is clear that the data is being captured in the DHIS2 database already, it would simply be beneficial to have this available as a DE so that graphs and linelists can be created to monitor team performance.  \n\nBy being able to see who captured data (an event without registration or an event with registration) the data manager would be able to confirm whether the data capturer is capturing all the required data, whether it is being captured correctly and whether the data capturer is meeting performance targets. For example, a vaccinator is tasked to vaccinate 100 people per day. The data manager would then be able to create a graph or linelist of the data captured by that individual based on the DE. As the DE is automatically completed with the username of the data capturer, the timeliness of data capture is not affected with a field that is repeated for every record captured. \n\n##",

For example for a Data Set:\n\nBy selecting the bar chart icon at the bottom right, the user can access the offline analytics configured for that Data set or a Tracker Program:\n\nAs the DHIS2-RTS is built on a conventional Tracker Program but uses its own, bespoke, user interface this offline analytics button is not available.\n\nThe only way to configure and display any offline analytics for the DHIS2-RTS would be to configure a second \"dummy\" Tracker Program for the sole purpose of displaying offline analytics. But the user would have to close the DHIS2-RTS and open the \"dummy\" Tracker Program every time they want to consult any analytics.\n\n**Desired behaviour**\n\nBy default the user is able to toggle between the DHIS2-RTS user interface at any stage of any transaction and the offline analytics by selecting the same icons as already in use (see above).\n\nThe user is able to toggle between transactions and consulting the stock card easily and at any time with a single click.\n\nThis feature basically ensures parity between \"conventional\" Tracker Programs and the \"bespoke\" DHIS2-RTS and will in particular be needed, once the Line Listing is available in the offline analytics which is envisaged for 2.10.\n\n**As a DHIS2-RTS user (storkeepeer)**\n\n**When** - using the DHIS2-RTS for day-to-day work of recording stock transactions (stock receipt, distribution, discard and correction)\n\n**I want to** - review and analyze (recent) transactions on the mobile device, even if the local database was not (yet) synchronized with the central server and without having to open another application (such as using the PWA).\n\n**So I can** - immediately study (recent) transactions for my own work as well as providing customers with information on (recent) transactions.\n\n**Who faces this problem and how important is it to them?**\n\nAll storekeepers managing medical stores. Consulting records on past transactions is indispensable and part of the day-to-day work.\n\nDescribe which users, countries, or use-cases face the problem, as well as how important the problem is to them.\n\nAll (current and future) DHIS2-RTS users.\n\nHow do they solve these problems today?\n\nResort to paper records such as batch cards and bin cards.\n\nP.S.: this feature may no longer be needed if the analytics (including line listing) are available from the home screen (rather than from “inside” the respective Tracker Programs).

However this case is very unlikely and therefore not part of the business requirements (as differentiation would require to also store the manufacturer name of every batch which would greatly complicate the system)\n\n** Batches are always managed and represented in the chronological order of their expiry dates (the user does not have the possibility to change the order in the interface) with the batch number with the shortest remaining shelf live (nearest expiry date) being displayed first\n\n** In the exceptional case of more than one batch number for the same item and the same expiry date, the system will display those items in the alphabetical order of their batch numbers\n\n** FEFO (first-expiry first-out) management by definition requires to deplete the entire stock of any batch before taking any quantity from the next batch\n\n** The system automatically \"hides\" any batches with a \"Stock\" of zero.\n\n** Different manufacturers use different conventions for expiry dates for example only indicating the month and year or the day, month and year and in various formats (without separation or dots or slashes as separators). However, these inconsistencies are not a concern for DHIS2-RTS as the expiry date has to be uploaded into the system and must be GS1 DataMatrix code compatible at that stage (regardless of the electronic data which is being loaded into DHIS2, any necessary conversions must be done by the national eLMIS system)\n\n** In alignment with current DHIS2 conventions, expiry dates are presented in the format YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY (all indicated as numbers) depending on the \"Calendar settings\" of the DHIS2 \"System Settings\" app\n\n** Batch number fields are alphanumeric (numbers and letters), may contain special characters such as blank spaces, hyphens, dots etc. and allow up to 20 characters\n\n** By default, the user interface displays only a list of items and the total quantities in stock but without any details of batch numbers and expiry dates (as this would lead to extensively long lists and users never need a complete list of all batches / expiry dates at the same time)\n\n** The user does not have the possibility of \"expanding\" the entire item list to show the batch numbers and expiry dates for all items (instead the user has to select a single item)\n\n** When the user selects any specific item (by search or by scanning) the sublist with the batch numbers and expiry dates is always displayed automatically (but always only for a single item at a time)\n\n** When the users scrolls down the list and taps on any item, this single item is displayed together with the sublist of batch numbers and expiry dates (in the same way as when an item is selected by searching or scanning)\n\n** Items without batches are displayed only as a single line (as in the overview list)\n\n** When the user has completed selecting the required quantities for each batch number and expiry date, the user selects a new button \"Select new item\" which takes her/him back to the item list for selecting the next item\n\n** Batches which have expired cannot be selected by the user\n\n**User interface for items selected by searching, tapping or scanning**\n\nThe batch number(s) and expiry date(s) are added to each item as a sublist in the following way (illustration is indicative and will be aligned to DHIS2 Android conventions):\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|81,000| |\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|23,000| |\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|4,000| |\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|13,000| |\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|8,000| |\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|33,000| |\n\n** the \"Stock\" in the header row (indicating the item) indicates the total quantity in stock (corresponding and always being identical with the sum of the quantities of every batch)\n\n** the \"Stock\" next to each of the batch numbers / expiry dates indicates the quantity on hand for each of the respective batches.\n\n**Work flow**\n\nThe entire logic of the workflow remains the same but there is a significant change in that the user must first select a single item before being able to enter any quantities This change is made to avoid the need for displaying an endlessly long list of all items and batches as well as for preventing user errors which are more likely if the batch numbers and expiry dates of many items are displayed in the same interface. This change also improves the user experience as the item description will always appear at the top of the list with ample place to display the batch numbers and expiry dates (only for this one specific item).\n\nThe other significant changes is that the user still enters the total required quantity but the system automatically calculates a suggestion for the quantities of each batch number and expiry date the user should pick according to FEFO (but allows the user to \"override\" the recommended selection which should be very exceptional).\n\n*The additional steps required in the workflow for the batch number and expiry date management are indicated in italics and in red*.\n\nUser:\n\n** receives a written request from departments, services or community health workers indicating a list of healthcare products and their quantities which are requested and need to be prepared by the pharmacy\n** starts the mobile device\n** open the DHIS2-RTS mobile app\n** selects the transaction type \"Distribution\" [\"Discard\" or \"Correction\"]\n** selects the \"Organisation Unit\" (name of the healthcare facility) if s/he has access to more than one\n** selects the ward/service etc. which is requesting the goods and for which the order picking is carried out\n** selects the first item by scrolling and tapping on the item, searching or using the barcode scanner\n** *as soon as any item is selected, the user interface displays a single item with the sublist of batches and expiry dates [new]*\n** *if the user made a mistake s/he can revert back to the item list at any time by selecting the \"back\" button (arrow) at the top left of the screen (any quantities entered are lost)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *are blocked from entering any \"Quantity\" for batches which are expired*\n** *the \"Review\" button is displayed at the bottom of the screen*\n** *if the quantity entered by the user exceeds the total available quantity, an error message is displayed, the user is blocked from proceeding and must reduce the quantity*\n** *system calculates the quantities of each batch (starting with the first FEFO batch) until the required quantity is reached and indicates the quantity calculated for each batch number and expiry date in the \"Quantity\" field*\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|21,000|60000|\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|0|23,000|\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|0|4,000|\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|0|13,000|\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|0|8,000|\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|21,000|12,000|\n\n** *has the possibility of altering those quantities (but only up to the total of each batch, the user is not able to select quantities which lead to negative stocks)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field of the requested batch*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *if the user changes the \"Quantity\" for any of the batch numbers, the total \"Quantity\" for the item will adjust to that change*\n** *selects \"Select next item\" button at the bottom right*\n** proceeds to search for or scan the next item\n** selects the \"Review\" button (on the user interface with the complete list of items)\n** system opens the \"Review\" interface and displays the \"Confirm\" button\n** system displays only the items with the total quantities which were selected\n** *if the user requires to review details at the batch number and expiry date level during the review s/he selects one item (at a time) by searching, tapping or scanning*\n** *system shows the item code of the selected item in the search window and one item with all the selected batch numbers and expiry dates with the selected quantities*\n** *reverts to the \"Review\" user interface by tapping on the \"x\" in the search window*\n** *system shows the \"Review\" user interface (only with items and the total quantities selected)*\n** selects the \"Confirm\" button\n** system reverts to the DHIS2-RTS home screen\n** informs the requester to pick up the goods are delivers them to the requesting department/service\n\n**Issues to be resolved**\n\n** Batches with a \"Stock\" of zero are not displayed by the system but if a mistake was made and the user needs to enter a \"Correction\" batch numbers and expiry dates with a \"Stock\" of zero need to be displayed in case stock is found to actually not be zero. Displaying all batches which ever where in stock is not practical. Perhaps the last five batch numbers and expiry dates which were \"emptied\" can be displayed only in the \"Correction\" user interface.\n\n** Should items with batch numbers but without expiry dates be managed by FIFO?\n\nxxx\n\nCorrection on 25.01.2024\n\n** Every Tracked Entity is specified by an item code (mandatory) and item description (mandatory)\n- Individual batch numbers / expiry dates are created by multiple “enrollments” of the same TEI (item) at the same OU. This has the advantage that in order to remove depleted batches (stock on hand = 0) individual enrollments can be “hidden” using the native “Completed” functionality.",

So I can get only the filtered information from the API I am interested \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nDevelopers working with the DHIS2 API often require sophisticated filtering capabilities.

When configuring items to see in the data view via settings, there is no options for “registering unit”. I’ve noticed this is available for TEIs, but not for event programs. I know we can see registration units in line lists, or even click into the org unit hierarchy to see records associated with that unit, but I think it would still be useful to see the registering unit when viewing all events together.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\nCurrently, I work on a project that uses event programs in capture for 25 different districts and 5 provinces. Oftentimes, to do simple monitoring and checks, I’d rather see all events in a long list (including the registering unit), rather than clicking through each individual orgunit to see the events associated.\n\n### \n\n##",

The line list has to be created using the Line Listing DHIS2 web App, and then configured to be displayed in Android using the Android Settings Web App (ASWA), as any other offline analytics in Android. In this case Line lists can be displayed in the home screen, and event or tracker programs (as they do not really apply to aggregated data, they are not displayed in Datasets). Users will be able to search by period, Org. unit, or any of the columns added in the Line List.\n\nThere are some limitations to the line lists to be displayed in the Android App. The Org. units and Periods must be relative, not fixed. And there is a maximum number of columns of 15.  Android Local Analytics are built using local data, and wil, update instantly as more data gets collected (or downloaded) in the device. The App will display a maximum of 500 rows and will inform the user when the limit is reached.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/visual-configurations.html#capture*app*visual*event*visualizations) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-206-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-206-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-206-Image02.png) | [3](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-206-Image03.png)\n\n## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nIn the context of a health facility stock control, any user of the mobile app should be able to view a complete record of all past transactions in order to replace the paper stock card with a digital stock card.

The global shell will ensure consistent headerbar and command pallet as well as other common global functionality such as alerts, session management, and more.\n\nOptional support for a global app shell has been released in DHIS2 v41.  By default, web applications are served independently.  However, an application with the name “global-app-shell” can be optionally installed and will subsequently be served instead of individual web applications.  All applications, both bundled and installed, will be harmonized and served from the {{/apps}} path, rather than for example {{/dhis-web-dashboard}} or {{/api/apps/my-app}}.  Accessing apps at their previous paths will redirect the user to the new location.\n\nAs a fallback, apps can be accessed directly at their old locations by appending the {{?redirect=false}} query paramenter.  For example, the app management app can be accessed directly from the browser at {{/dhis-web-app-management/index.html?redirect=false}} - this is useful for uninstalling a misbehaving global app shell, for example.",

For example with the DHIS2 for education implementation in Uganda, we are working on departmental dashboards pulling data from one single tool - the termly tool. We would therefore like to have a dashboard label for Termly Tool data and then below have various tabs to navigate the different pages under there such as school health, school feeding etc. Example below:\n\nThis is how the dashboards currently are. We had to create individual dashboards for each of the departments which are pulling data from the same tool.\n\n \n\n \n\nThis here is what we suggest, is it possible for us to have a single dashboard but within there, one can have tabs through which a user can navigate to view the different categories of data.\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01 (1).png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01.png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!dashboard tabs (1).jpg|width=1640,height=924!\n\n!dashboard tabs.jpg|width=1640,height=924!",

Providing usage information will allow system owners to help pinpoint org units / users experiencing troubles; correlate usage rates to system expenditures (e.g. internet costs; hardware needs); identify specific areas (geographical and content) for future training; for measuring impact, with usage rates providing important context for further analysis. \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAs of 2.29, default analytics include only aggregate:\n\n** Favorite views\n** Favorites saved\n** Active users vs. Total users\n** Top favorites\n** Total data values saved\n\nProposed default analytic enhancements:\n\n** filtering by org unit\n** exposing org unit details when selected\n** Log on rates per program / per org unit based on data capture org unit assignment\n** Program stage completion rates\n** export of tables and visualization as both images and raw data\n** use of program rules to send notification to admin team based on configured inactivity rates per org unit (e.g. certain time with no log on; certain time with no updated data values)\n** Saving new analytics for use in Admin dashboard\n** Adding analytics to dashboards\n** Dashboard view counts \n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nSystem admins want to be able to monitor user activities to monitor completion of data entry tasks (programs and data entry), data use activities, and general app usage. \n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\n** End users give permission or admins have the authority to monitor DHIS2 usage. \n** Could result in complex log scraping and new data tables that could further hinder performance overall \n** Had to know how to measure “analytics usage”. It could be many thing that few directly translate to “data use”.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nMany large scale DHIS2 implementations \n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nTBD\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered*|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

      "description": "## Release Notes Description\n\n**New Capture Coordinates process:**  Introducing new features designed to enhance the capture coordinates process. These improvements aim to provide greater accuracy, flexibility, and control over location data capture.\n\n** **Accuracy:** The capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time. This parameter can also be restricted using the Android Settings WebApp.\n** **Search Functionality:** A new search functionality has been added, allowing users to look up specific locations by name or address. Users are also able to navigate through the map and perform area searches to discover other locations within a specified region. \n** **Block Manual Capture:* Using the Android Settings Web App, administrators now have the option to block manual location capture. When this setting is enabled, users can only capture the current location and cannot manually select or search a different one. This ensures that location data remains consistent and accurate.\n\n[+Jira+](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-6330) | [+Release card 1+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-disabled-manual-capture.png) | [+Release card 2+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-accuracy.png) | [+Release card 3+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-search.png) | [+Documentation1+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*map*accuracy) +|+ [+Documentation 2+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/settings-configuration.html#capture*app*android*settings*webapp*appearance*program*specific)\n\n## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nThe Android App needs to display the current accuracy in the coordinates selector when capturing current location. This provides a helpful prompt to recapture if the accuracy is low. Without this visual indicator, users capture very inaccurate coordinates without realizing. \n\nThis need applies to any coordinate capture using the mobile app - Enrollment, Event and data element coordinates.\n\nThis will provide much-needed accuracy to community-level data capturing. which will ensure improved quality of geo coordinates especially at the household level. overall, good accuracy improves quality of data entry at the community level.\n\n## :people*holding_hands: Users description\n\nHelpful in urban and rural environments across multiple users and teams (EPI, bed nets, deliveries, entomology sentinel sites) and associated varied devices. Translates to cleaner map visuals for all MOH levels, partners, funders.\n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nWhen users are collecting coordinates with their mobile phone, the accuracy of the actual coordinates is not displayed in the user interface. However, GPS coordinates can be extremely inaccurate, but we know that accuracy improves with time or if the user captures coordinate 2-3 times. \n\nThe GPS feature currently is not trustworthy, and users need to confirm their GPS location as sometimes the signal is not very strong, resulting in inaccurate data capture. \n\nWithout displaying accuracy information, it is very easy to just tap it and forget about whether the reading is accurate or not. Users are constantly capturing inaccurate GPS coordinates, simply because they are not getting visual feedback to re-capture. Displaying the accuracy will allow implementers to train users on leveraging this information to try capturing a few more times to let the accuracy increase .\n\nIn door to door data collection deliveries and sometimes the coordinates don't come as accurate as users don't have idea of the accuracy then collecting the coordinates.",

      "description": "## 🎯 High Level use case \n\nIndividuals and community members are active participants in their own health and the health of their communities.Empowering individuals to report on their own health data through mobile solutions enables more *robust data collection* and facilitates *task shifting* among the health workforce. Health workers’ time traditionally spent on data collection & reporting can be reallocated to improve data analysis and patient-centered care. Finally, self-reporting and feedback loops can expand the reach of health interventions and data systems to individuals who face barriers accessing health facilities. \n\nSelf monitoring implies that patients can access their own health record and consult and update their own health data. In some cases patinents will only need to see their data wihtout need to edit. \n\nThis use case is extended here> [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136) \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nPatients that are already registered in a health program.\n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nIn some cases / health programs patients are in really remote areas and having health staff monitoring them is not feasible, not even community health staff. Some programs requiere dayli upadtes and patients are requested to keep track of themselves and then, weekly or bi-weekley, when visited by a health worker they report all that information that is in many cases forgotten or not well recorded. Visits of this nature also take  alot of time.\n\nIn other cases, for example an epidemic, even if patinets are reachable, is simply not manageable to monitor them on daily basis, or not recommended for infectious risks. \n\n## 🤔 Assumptions\n\nThe patient is already regitsered in the system.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nThis use case was already studied during covid. The source are many inputs from the community. \n\nReference douments from that study can be found here: \n\n** [Self reporting concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGMxHg*02UaJvpnPldRJ2uBBlK2UsyibPiwjXC*JGQg/edit#heading=h.midsb1pv3ak1)\n** [Self reporting user stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cB0YP*tS0ZL4wdaJQSN1wuDo*SLj6R9tO-LnaehBXiQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nSelf reporting could be addressed at different levels (see below). This Idea is refering to number 5. Self monitoring. The other use casesa re out of scope.\n\n1. Self assessment: mobile tools that enable an individual to make a self-assessment about whether he/she has COVID-10 symptoms\n1. Self reporting of aggregate/non-identifiable data: these user stories included mass surveys for individuals to report in whether or not they have COVID-19-like symptoms; only aggregate data are captured primarily for public health analytics purposes\n1. Self-identification: an individual is “unknown” to the health care system and make themself known through software (e.g. Tanzania hotline: individual calls hotline and phone number is pushed to DHIS2 event program through USSD solution for follow up\n1. Self-registration: an individual records their own details to ease the burden of the health workers on registration (e.g. a patient ‘self enrolls’ into a suspected COVID-19 case program\n1. Self-monitoring: an individual has had contact with the health system to be enrolled into some sort of longitudinal monitoring program, but they submit data themselves during the course of follow up period (e.g. an individual is registered into DHIS2 program by a CHW as a contact of a confirmed case and submit updates everyday for 14 days about whether or not they have developed symptoms)\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|How will patinets identify/authenticate themselves?| | |",

In other cases users have issues syncing and the admin users admins needs to force a syncronization in a particular moment to replicate an error and be able to troubleshoot.\n\n## ℹ️ Sources\n\nThis issue comes from collecting input during field visits and academies.\n\n## (!) Out of Scope\n\nNot identified at the moment.\n\n## (?) Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|N/A| | |",

Terms include school holidays and breaks that should not be included as expected days of reporting. \n\nThis could be generically applied to cohort, unique financial years, EPI weeks, or campaign periods analysis where data ranges are used to define cohorts and analytics should be applied/isolated to those date ranges. \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nUsers are analytics and data entry users that need to capture or visualize data by term. \n\n## ❓ Problem Description\n\nThe issues is that DHIS2 does not allow for configurable period ranges to be used for data entry or analytics.

Backend supports merging the following metadata objects through the web API: Organisation Units, Data Elements, Indicators, Indicator Types, Category options, Category option combinations (limited to one use case, when the Category option combinations are the same). Frontend support through the user interface is gradually implemented as well. So far the new Maintenance app supports merging options for Category options, Indicators and Indicator types. In these cases the user is able to select the “source” object to merge and the “target” object to merge references to.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-master/metadata.html#webapi*indicator*merge) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/42/42-configure-metadata-deduplication.png) | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3",

When creating or editing a metadata element (e.g., a data element or indicator), I should have the option to upload and link images or media files as visual references.\n1. Each attached image or media file should be associated with a specific metadata element, allowing it to serve as a visual guide or example for data collectors.\n1. Data collectors should be able to access these visual references when entering data for the corresponding metadata element, providing them with visual context and clarity about the data to be collected.\n1. The system should support common image and media formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, MP4) for attaching visual references.\n1. There should be clear documentation and guidance on how to upload and manage visual references for metadata elements.",

Introducing a user-friendly way to navigate though many dashboards would help increase user engagement and drive more analysis. \r\n\r\nPEPFAR Use case: PEPFAR has begun to roll out dashboards that are static to each time period, this has lead to a fast increase in the number of publicly available (r---------) dashboards in the system. It would be very useful to make it easier for users to find the dashboard/information they are looking for if a superuser could group dashboards together so that they appear as a single entity at the top of the screen, and when clicked worked something like the organization unit hierarchy. I can think of examples where multiple layers maybe used, something like groups and group sets, but even a single layer of grouping would be useful.",

However, currently there isn't feature to add new image in icon list. So we really want to have a function where we can add our own icon image, or pictures. The other requirement is the size of cell contain data element can be adjust to the size of image, so that we can display the image better for user rather than the tiny icon that DHIS2 has now. \r\n\r\n!image-2020-07-14-11-07-15-561.png|width=382,height=446!\r\n\r\nI would like to add some requirement details about this. \r\n\r\nRecently the android app allow add icon for option sets.

Furthermore, there should be a possibility to have a system generated \"other\" category that will put together data for the remaining causes that are not in the leading causes.",
