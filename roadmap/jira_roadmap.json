      "description": "## üí≠ Problem definition\n\n### What problem or job are we going after?\n\nAs an analyst, I want to bulk export DHIS2 events for analysis in another tool. Data needed include only minimal clinical values, org unit, date, and relevant demographics (age range and sex).\n\nIn my program, TEI have many events, so I create the event based LL, with the expectation is that I can use some index variable to link each TEI to all of their attached events. I then download the data as CSV/excel for processing and regression analysis elsewhere.\n\nThere are currently three ‚Äúindex variables‚Äù I could use to identify to link individuals to their events in the LL: the TEI ID, enrollment ID, and a national ID (TEI Attribute). \n\nEach of these is sensitive information. If I were to download the report and share it with a research partner, exposes the unique ID for patients and, with API access, a record could be backtraced and  looked up to find additional PII.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*This was an issue when downloading data for research to share outside the program, and required a custom script to clean the enrollment ID and replace with an internal index value.*\n\n**Feature idea**\n\nHashing all internal UIDs related to an event (event, enrollment, and TEI) at the time of export from LL would be a *relatively* low-cost step to improving security of tracker data globally. It would remove one way to backtrace to find specific patients based on an ‚Äúanonymized‚Äù data export.",

      "description": "**Problem Definition**\n\n**What problem or job are we addressing?**\n\nIn order to deploy DHIS2 applications efficiently and at scale, implementers including ICRC and many other partners face a persistent challenge: reducing reliance on traditional training sessions (virtual or in-person) to onboard users. This issue is not unique to ICRC or a specific use case; it is a universal barrier to efficient DHIS2 adoption across different countries, sectors, and implementations.\n\nWhile documentation and training materials exist, when these are hosted externally, users are less likely to access or engage with them especially when under time pressure, dealing with poor connectivity, or operating in resource-limited settings.\n\n**User Story and Scenario**\n\n**As a** DHIS2 user (e.g., a health worker using the RTS app for the first time),\n**When** I log into the app and feel unsure where to begin,\n**I want to** access a built-in tutorial that highlights core features, shows me what to do step-by-step, and adapts to my user role,\n**So I can** quickly become self-sufficient, confident, and productive without waiting for external training or guides.\n\nThis is especially relevant when:\n\n** Users return to the system after a long absence (e.g., due to staff turnover).\n** Solutions are updated or reconfigured, requiring quick re-orientation.\n** Implementers deploy the solution in new settings where training resources are limited.\n\n**Proposed Feature**\n\nIntroduce a configurable, embedded in-app tutorial system for DHIS2 Web and Capture apps that:\n\n** Appears on **first login** and is accessible anytime from a ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù menu.\n** Supports interactive, step-by-step walkthroughs that highlight key UI elements and actions (e.g., ‚Äúclick here to submit a report‚Äù).\n** Is role-aware, showing relevant steps based on user access levels.\n** Can be configured offline, allowing tutorials to be bundled with the application package for use in low-connectivity environments.\n** Offers anonymous usage tracking (optional), helping developers and implementers understand which tutorial steps are most helpful or confusing.\n** Enables customization by implementers, allowing them to include localized content, links to relevant resources, or context-specific instructions.\n\n**Who Faces This Problem & Why It Matters**\n\nThis challenge affects a broad spectrum of DHIS2 users globally from frontline health workers to data officers in humanitarian settings. It is especially pressing in:\n\n** Low-resource or fragile environments, where internet connectivity is unreliable and scheduled trainings are difficult.\n** Programs with high staff turnover, where onboarding must be repeatable and asynchronous.\n** Large-scale deployments, where central training is logistically complex and costly.\n\nFor many, the lack of in-app onboarding leads to:\n\n** Underutilization of key features,\n** Increased helpdesk load,\n** Delays in data reporting and decision-making,\n** Reduced satisfaction with the application.\n\n**Current Workarounds (and their Limitations)**\n\n**Current onboarding approaches include**:\n\n** Live virtual or in-person training sessions, which require coordination, bandwidth, and time.\n** Sharing PDFs, videos, or links to external learning platforms, which often go unused or are forgotten.\n** Embedding notes or ‚Äúhelp‚Äù text within the app, which lacks interactivity and user engagement.\n\nThese methods are often ineffective, especially when the user is new, overwhelmed, or in a hurry.\n\n**Expected Impact**\n\nAn embedded, interactive tutorial will:\n\n** Reduce onboarding time and support costs,\n** Improve user satisfaction and app adoption,\n** Support self-paced learning and re-orientation,\n- Foster broader usability in humanitarian and health contexts.",

      "description": "There are 2 quite different types of events in the system, single events and tracker events. Single events are not tracker-based because they are not attached to a tracked entity but register a generic one-time event in a program.Tracker events, however, are linked to a tracked entity and a specific enrollment. Both types of events are modeled by the same objects and tables but some fields are specific only to one of them. For example, single events use an enrollment placeholder, with a null tracked entity, only to work the same as tracker events.\n\nModeling two different entities in the same way creates a few problems all over the system:\n\n** Different validations are applied to different types, so in the validation code is common to find the check to differentiate between types.\n** Missing fields that do not make sense for one or another type need to be added by preprocessors in the tracker importer. \n** ACL works differently in each type.\n** The placeholder enrollment can have ~thousands/millions of events while a tracker enrollment generally has few events. Mixing the two types in some parts of the code can lead to serious performance issues.\n** Rule engine works differently for program events and tracker events.\n** Event exporter need to deal with 2 different types of event and cannot be easily optimized.\n\nWe will there separate tracker events and single events in importer/exporter to improve all the points above as well as performance.",

I suggest that more filters be created so that users can select specific years, specific data sets, and also the organization units. This way, someone can easily generate analytic tables, for instance, for their planned training, without waiting 26 hours for the analytics to run. Very frustrating.*\n\n##",

This will support IDSR use cases where timely submission for weekly IDSR data is Monday at 12 (noon), which is 0.5 days after period end on Sunday midnight.\n\nWith DHIS2 increasingly being used for IDSR where rapid reporting etc are a must, this change will increasingly be used to set timeliness requirements less than one day, or in some cases e.g. 1.5 days.  Historically this parameter has been mostly used for timeliness of \"long transaction\" monthly aggregated data (the term \"long transaction\" is a term used for data processes that take considerable time - in the DHIS2 case typically 5-20 days after the end of the month). Disease surveillance data is different, because rapid submission of e.g. outbreak data is of vital importance for the early containment of epidemics. Such data is also increasingly being submitted directly from health facilities or clinicians, using browsers or the Android Capture app.\n\nDocumentation | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/42/42-collect-timely-submission.png) | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3",

These links lead to external resources, such as training material hosted on other platforms.\nWe would like to request the integration of a similar feature into the DHIS2 Android app. This would enable app users to access documentation, tutorials, or short videos directly from their mobile devices. The goal is to provide the same level of support and training resources for mobile users as we currently do for web users.\n**Proposed Features:**\n\n** **Resource Repository:** A section in the Android app where documentation, links, or videos can be attached and accessed.\n** **Dashboard Integration:** The ability to display and link these resources from within dashboards in the app.\n** **Offline Access :** An option to download specific resources for offline use.\nImpact:\nThis feature would greatly enhance user experience and ensure that DHIS2 app users have the necessary support and training resources at their fingaertips, fostering better adoption and utilization of the platform.\n**Steps to Reproduce (current behavior):**\n** Navigate to the DHIS2 web version.\n** Go to **Reports** > **Resource** and store links/documents.\n** Observe that these resources are not accessible from the Android app.\nThank you for considering this feature request!",

      "description": "As a DHIS2 implementer, I need the ability to delete scheduled messages using program rules when certain conditions are no longer met. This feature would enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of our notification system within DHIS2.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, DHIS2 allows scheduling messages through program rules using the \"SCHEDULEMESSAGE\" action. However, there is no direct way to delete these scheduled messages using program rules when conditions change.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nImplement a new program rule action type called \"DELETESCHEDULEDMESSAGE\" that allows the deletion of previously scheduled messages based on specified criteria.\n\nDetailed Requirements:\n\n1. Add a new action type \"DELETESCHEDULEDMESSAGE\" to the list of available program rule actions.\n\n1. The action should accept parameters to identify which scheduled message(s) to delete, such as:\n\n** Program\n\n** Program Stage (optional)\n\n** Data element or attribute that triggered the original scheduled message\n\n** Original scheduled date range (if applicable)\n\n1. When the program rule condition evaluates to true, the action should remove any matching scheduled messages from the system.\n\n1. Provide appropriate error handling and logging for cases where no matching scheduled messages are found.\n\nUse Case Examples:\n\nIn a maternal health program, a message is scheduled when a pregnant woman's hemoglobin level is below a certain threshold. If a subsequent test shows improved levels, we need to cancel the previously scheduled follow-up message.\n\nIn a TB contact tracing program where data entry forms are strictly configured not to allow scheduling events, a message is scheduled when contacts are referred to a health facility and have not appeared at the health facility after 7 days. If the contact subsequently appear before the 7th day, the previously scheduled notification need to be deleted.\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n\n** This feature would likely require modifications to the program rule engine, notification schedules and the messaging subsystem.\n\n** Consider performance implications of searching for scheduled messages to delete.\n\n- Ensure proper access control so that only authorized program rules can delete scheduled messages.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Improved accuracy of notifications sent to patients and health workers.\n\n1. Reduced manual intervention required to manage scheduled messages.\n\n1. Enhanced ability to create dynamic, condition-based communication workflows.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThis feature request is based on community discussions and the need for more flexible message management in DHIS2 programs. It aligns with the existing capabilities of scheduling messages through program rules and would complete the lifecycle management of these notifications.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or clarification on this feature request.",

It‚Äôs especially important for large organizations or country implementations where there are numerous dashboards for different programs, projects, or regions. These users need efficient dashboard organization to enhance usability, improve workflow efficiency, and reduce the cognitive load of finding the right dashboards for specific tasks.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users work around this limitation by using naming conventions to group dashboards or manually scrolling through the dashboard list to locate the relevant one. This can be time-consuming, especially in implementations with a high volume of dashboards. Additionally, users may rely on keeping lists of dashboard names, but these approaches are neither efficient nor scalable in environments with complex dashboard structures.",

This feature would be especially valuable in high-usage contexts where users repeatedly enter data for the same set of organization units, as it would help them perform their tasks more efficiently.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users manually search through the full list of organization units each time they enter data. In cases with extensive hierarchies, this requires scrolling and searching, which can be time-consuming and error prone.",

Storekeepers select the items they want to order one by one and then enter the order quantity. Healthcare facilities need to purchase all goods from the central medical store and have limited budgets. Therefore they would like to calculate the value of their orders ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù. This calculation is possible with a Program indicator but requires saving the Event, then moving to the analytics screen, checking the total value and then moving back to the main Event program screen.\n\n!image-20240926-153301.png|width=361,height=743,alt=\"image-20240926-153301.png\"!\n\n**As a storekeeper (DHIS2 user)**\n\n**When** ‚Äì placing an order in the dedicated Event program\n\n**I want to** ‚Äì view the updated total cost of my order on the Event home screen\n\n**So I can** ‚Äì adjust the ordered items and quantities without having to switch between UIs.\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAll users of 90 healthcare facilities in the Comoros whenever they place their orders, usually two to three times per month.\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nUsers calculate the order value manually with a calculator.",

Every storekeeper must use the most recent stock on hand data from the storekeeper on the previous shift or who worked on the previous day. However, currently the Capture Android app data is cached by user/instance/device which means that every storekeeper would be using the stock data from their previous shift, even if it was days or even weeks ago (in case of sick leave or holidays). This means that any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between two logins of a certain user, will always be wrong for every user. Two work arounds are available but are both not ideal for different reasons.\n\n**As a DHIS2 administrator**\n\n**When** ‚Äì implementing DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management tool) anywhere\n\n**I want to** ‚Äì force mobile devices to synchronise (only) the DHIS2-RTS Tracker program during login and logout\n\n**So the next user ‚Äì** will use the correct and most recent stock position (of the user which was previously logged in) and not the stock position of the user who is logging in. This user might have logged in the last time days ago (or even weeks ago in case of sick leave or holidays) and the cached stock position will be completely outdated.\n\n**Who faces the problem**\n\nThis problem was encountered during the current DHIS2-RTS implementation (September 2024) in the Comoros but all DHIS2-RTS implementations are affected.\n\nAll users are affected by this problem and if there is more than one user using the same mobile device, the stock position will always be wrong for all users. To be precise: any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between the login of a certain user, will be wrong.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nThe problem can be avoided by ensuring that all users synchronises the mobile device right after logging in and right before logging out. However, sooner or later a user will forget. Morever, the Internet connection is not always available and if a user cannot synchronise data before going home, s/he will not wait for the Internet to return.\n\nThe current solution is to simply ask all users to use the same credentials which is not ideal from a security point of view.\n\n**Proposed feature**\n\nThe DHIS2 Administrator has the option of ‚Äúforcing‚Äù the synchronisation for a specific Program after login and during logout in the Android-settings app which gives users a choice.",

      "description": "As a data entry user, clerk, etc, who uses a language which is not English, I want to be able to search for and interact with data and metadata which contains accented characters across all elements, including Org Units, Tracked Entities, and other attributes so that I can find and manage records accurately regardless of accents or diacritics.\n\n**For example:**\nOrg Units: Users may search for an Org Unit like \"Canc√∫n,\" but the system fails to return results when \"Cancun\" (without the accent) is used as the search term. This becomes problematic, especially in large hierarchies where exact matches are critical for locating Org Units quickly.\n\nTracked Entities: A data manager searching for a tracked entity with the name \"Fran√ßois\" may not find it when searching for \"Francois\" (without the accent), leading to inefficiency and potentially missing important health records.\n\nAttributes and Data Elements: Fields that use accented characters (such as addresses, place names, or custom data fields) may not match unless the exact accented spelling is used, causing issues in reporting, data aggregation, and analysis. (Indicators and program indicators too, for example searching in Data Visualizer, detailed in [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-15422](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-15422) )\n\nCurrent behaviour affects the user experience negatively and creates unnecessary hurdles, especially for non-technical users and those working in multilingual regions where keyboards might not match software. Current filtering is anglocentric and does not serve the wider community.\t\n\t\n**Acceptance Criteria**\t\n\nDHIS2 should be accent-insensitive across all elements (Org Units, Tracked Entities, Attributes, Data Elements, etc.).\n\nSearch operations should treat accented and non-accented characters as equivalent (e.g., \"Canc√∫n\" and \"Cancun\" should return the same results).\n\nAll existing DHIS2 components (Org Units, Tracked Entities, Data Elements, Attributes, etc.) should support accent-insensitive searches to improve usability and accuracy across the platform.",

Usually I have tried to avoid adding to the metadata but to add something like a new function inside the expression.

However, I have observed that presenting the entire form at once can be overwhelming and may lead to data entry errors. \n\nTo enhance the user experience and improve data accuracy, I propose a feature that allows data collectors to view and respond to one question at a time, with the ability to navigate to the next question by swiping. This approach would help maintain focus on each question, reduce cognitive load, and ensure that data collectors can complete the forms efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Use Case:** **Expected Behavior:**\n\n** **Single-Question Display:** When a data entry form is opened in the Android app, only one question should be displayed at a time.\n** **Swipe Navigation:** Data collectors should be able to swipe left or right to move to the next or previous question, respectively.\n** **Progress Indicator:** A progress bar or a question number indicator at the top or bottom of the screen would help users track their progress through the form.\n** **Data Validation:** As each question is answered, the app should validate the input before allowing the user to proceed to the next question. If there is an error, an appropriate message should be displayed.\n** **Review Mode:* After completing all the questions, data collectors should have the option to review their answers before final submission, either by swiping through the questions again or by viewing a summary screen.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*This is faced by the DHIS2 Android Capture users (field workers).*\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*There‚Äôs not currently a way round this in DHIS2*\n\nThis feature would greatly enhance the data collection process, particularly in scenarios where attention to detail is critical. I believe it would be a valuable addition to the DHIS2 Android app and would be appreciated by many users in the field.",

We have moved from a Lotus Note application to DHIS2 and this function was very important for the health data analysis when looking at the aggregation of data / analytics. We do work with partners in our operations, and we do collect data from them, and we therefore need to be able to assess if the data that we have is not reliable.

Implementing these features will streamline the search process, reducing the time and effort required for data entry.\n\n1. Key Benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced User Experience:\n#** Users will be able to perform more flexible and intuitive searches, increasing satisfaction and productivity.\n1. Improved Efficiency:\n#** The ability to use wild card searches and view best match results will reduce the time spent searching for organization units, allowing users to complete data entry tasks more quickly.\n1. Greater Accuracy:\n#** Best match functionality will help users find the most relevant organization units, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n1. Scope and Requirements:\n\n1. Wild Card Search:\n#** Implement wild card search capabilities to allow partial matches. For example, searching for \"Hosp**\" should return all organization units that start with \"Hosp\".\n1. Best Match Results:\n#** Introduce an algorithm to rank search results based on relevance, displaying the best matches at the top of the list.\n1. User Interface Adjustments:\n#** Modify the search interface to accommodate and display these new search features clearly.\n\n1. ICRC Specific Needs:\n\n** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) manages a large number of organization units. This vast hierarchy makes it challenging for users, especially those at higher levels, to find specific facilities quickly.\n** Variations in language and the use of accents or special characters can lead to inconsistencies in the names of organization units, further complicating the search process. For example, a facility's name might differ slightly depending on the language or presence of accented characters, making it difficult to locate using the current search functionality.\n** Implementing wild card searches and best match results will greatly assist our users by accommodating these variations and improving the accuracy and speed of their searches.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWhile the initial implementation may require adjustments in the backend search algorithms and interface design, the long-term benefits in terms of improved search efficiency and user satisfaction are significant. This feature will also position DHIS2 as a more user-friendly platform, potentially attracting more users and use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe believe that adding wild card search and best match functionality to the DHIS2 Data Entry app is a valuable enhancement that will greatly benefit users, particularly within the ICRC, by making the search process more efficient and accurate. We request that this feature be considered for inclusion in the DHIS2 roadmap.",

This is especially so when working with program indicators, where there is no tracker/event data at all, the cell is left as a blank rather than have a zero. I would like to have the option of assigning this blank/null cell a color when creating the legend.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nWhen creating a legend, a user should be able to assign a color for null values as well (just like in maps). This way, if a user creates a pivot table and assigns it this legend, the cells which are blank/null will have the assigned color.",

      "description": "Understanding that space is a premium in a validation report UI, I think it would be helpful for two additional pieces of information to be prioritised in the output report that would **vastly** improve the usefulness of this report. (I am thinking the inclusion of this info is either in addition or in preference over existing info in the table. For example, the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù column could be taken out, and the report be grouped by section of high, medium, low, validation rules that could be expanded/collapsed by priority; and that would save the width of one column right away.) \n\n!image-20240612-114442.png|width=100%,alt=\"image-20240612-114442.png\"!\n\n*The curent validation rule analysis screen* missing *these key features.*\n\nThese new features are:\n\n** Instruction: this property is where we should be inputting the action a user should be taking (based on how it is used in the data entry app also) - in this report it would serve two purposes which are crucial. 1. It would help a user understand why the validation is showing in the first place (the name may not do that, which is in the table, so this is helpful extra context to help them know why the problem matters.) 2. It tells them what action should then be taken. \n** A link back to the data entry screen where rectification can then be taken to fix the value.\n**** If there is concern that a user with authority to run a validation analysis shouldn‚Äôt also be changing data - I‚Äôd suggest a toggle-able feature based upon the user authority for also being able to enter data.\n\nThank you - I think these two additions would be valuable. (In the interests of keeping this issue alive, let‚Äôs not say if you think one idea is good and one is bad, that both get thrown out - please adapt the issue. Ideally both would be good üòâ )",

The wide use of custom forms for aggregate data sets indicate that replicating the format/structure of the source document is the preferred way to do data entry from paper forms.\n\nThe current Capture app does not support this. First, custom forms are not supported, so attributes/data elements are always organised vertically with one field per row. Second, data entry is organised according to the design of the data model (i.e. attributes separately, forms split according to program stages).\n\nTracker data entry generally happens based on paper forms of two types:\n\n** Line lists, where each row represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n** Case/patient forms, where each form (e.g. A4 forms of one or more pages) represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n\nThis proposal is to support data entry interfaces for these two use cases.\n\nIn both cases, it should be possible to design the form/line list independent of whether fields are attributes, enrollment dates, event dates or data elements. It should be possible to use a single data entry field to represent multiple variables (for example, a ‚Äúregistration date‚Äù field could be used both as enrollment date and event date for a particular stage).\n\nThe line list functionality should be reviewed against the plans for editable working lists. However, unless the whole process (enrollment, multiple events etc) can be done, editable working lists do not elleviate the need for a line list interface.\n\n## The source of inputs\n\nNeed for line list/tabular data entry interface was discussed during C19, it is mention in [+capture app user stories+](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U72P63ZJW-5PuZBqYCSuO9lj95YLm8dQ4-kFznjVTn8/edit#gid=773129706), and there have been community apps that do this for events. This is primarily based on reflecting over and discussing the current situation in countries and how we support that.¬†\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-11415](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-11415) For EMIS, there is a need to have a user interface where one can easily pick a list of students and enter limited data for a specific stage. Typical use cases (as shown in the attached screenshots) are term grades for one or more subjects and attendance (in some cases rather absence).¬†¬†\n\n!image-20250721-133919.png|width=198,height=317,alt=\"image-20250721-133919.png\"!\n\n## The boundaries within which we should be analyzing (optional)\n\n----\n\nThe proposal is *not* about replacing the Capture app, which has much additional functionality beyond just data entry, but to complement it with more efficient and user-friendly ways of doing secondary data entry. Notably, since this is just about having a dedicated UI for data entry, implementations can combine or replace this with PoC data entry as they are ready; the underlying data model/configuration remains as today, and Capture can be used as today.",

      "description": "## üí≠ Problem definition\n\nCurrently, DHIS2 calculates completion rates taking into account all days, including weekends and public holidays. However, it has been identified that this approach can lead to inaccurate figures in EMIS, as weekends and public holidays should ideally be excluded from the calculation. Especially when you are collecting daily attendance data. As a consequence completeness rate can never be 100% even though data has been collected all the school days. Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Improved accuracy of completion rate calculations, providing more meaningful insights into attendance patterns.\n1. Better alignment of completion rate calculations with actual attendance data.\n1. Enhanced usability for organizations that require precise attendance analytics.",

For example, one section captures enrolment numbers (with disaggregations), and another captures condition of infrastructure using a drop-down (in good condition, needs minor repair, needs major repair).\n\nUsing tracker domain type to capture this kind of data would not be ideal since category combos would best support the disaggregations for enrolment, repeaters, staff, etc. While within the aggregate domain, there are analysis challenges with the fields that require text value types to be able to use¬†drop-downs.",

      "description": "## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nFor implementations in which the OU hierarchy opens and closes OU's constantly is difficult to work with the whole hierarchy, either for data entry or for the analytic apps. It would help having a tick to select the active org units, something like \"Show only active OUs\". This would hide the org units that are  currently closed (At the moment the user is using the system, not the reporting or selected period).\n\nFor analytics data displayed in results, would be enough to show data corresponding to the visible orgunits, independently from if any OU was opened during part of the selected periods. This is for day-to-day activities and users can work with the whole hierarchy if they want data from the past by not selecting this option.\n\nUser story:\n\nAs a **data analysis user**, I would like to be able to dinamically hide and show (toggle) closed org units in the analysis apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAs an **admin**, I would like to be able to hide closed org units in the data entry apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, some mechanism for archiving (e.g. excluding from analytics) could be handy (OUs could go from active to close to archive).¬†\n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAll data entry and analytics users in organizations that use an operational hierarchy. \n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nHaving an operational OU hierarchy instead of regional, OUs are opened and closed regularly (missions, projects, health sites, services‚Ä¶). As time passess by there are more and more closed (historic) org units. Normally there are more closed than open org. units. \nThey need to be kept in the hierarchy for retrospective analysis purpose, however for daily operations this becomes a barrier for user experience.\n\nCurrently, at admin level, we add the prefix ‚ÄúZZZ_‚Äù to the closed OUs so that they appear at the end of the list.\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nAn org unit is considered to be closed when the current date is outside the opening date and the closed date of the org unit. Refer to the {{openingDate}} and {{closedDate}} properties.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nCommunity (MSF and other NGOs that use operational hierarchies)\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nNot defined at the moment.\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|Would it be enough to ‚Äúhide empty rows?|No, for example to make a report by health facility.

This affects any instance, in any country. The problem is key to ensuring that data capture remains of high quality and that the individual performances of team members can be monitored. \n\nAlso mentioned here:\n\n [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-5883](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-5883) \n\nThe TEA is currently enabling the end user to select a username from a list of ALL users in the system (including those that are not attributed any rights or access to this specific program). Firstly, would it be possible to restrict the username list to those who have rights to the program?\n\nSecondly, for our use-case, it would be ideal to have some means to have the Username field auto-completed with the current user's username. However, I understand that this feature would not be ideal for all use-cases and therefore having it as an optional feature (in addition to the current list of users to select from) would be ideal.\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-12545](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-12545) \n\nUser Story\n\nAs a data entry user, I want the information about my user to be entered automatically into data elements related to my user data, so that it can be recorded in the event and it complies with reporting data without me having to enter my data every time.  For example: Me who is entering vaccine data and need to have my name and ID recorded, should not have to enter my name and ID each time I create an event. It should be autoassigned by the system.\n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nTHe ability to assign information about the Data entry user as a Data element value.\n\n## How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, data managers have to export data using the import/export app in CSV format to then determine what data was captured by each individual. This adds multiple layers of complexity and effort to team performance monitoring. It is clear that the data is being captured in the DHIS2 database already, it would simply be beneficial to have this available as a DE so that graphs and linelists can be created to monitor team performance.  \n\nBy being able to see who captured data (an event without registration or an event with registration) the data manager would be able to confirm whether the data capturer is capturing all the required data, whether it is being captured correctly and whether the data capturer is meeting performance targets. For example, a vaccinator is tasked to vaccinate 100 people per day. The data manager would then be able to create a graph or linelist of the data captured by that individual based on the DE. As the DE is automatically completed with the username of the data capturer, the timeliness of data capture is not affected with a field that is repeated for every record captured. \n\n##",

For example for a Data Set:\n\nBy selecting the bar chart icon at the bottom right, the user can access the offline analytics configured for that Data set or a Tracker Program:\n\nAs the DHIS2-RTS is built on a conventional Tracker Program but uses its own, bespoke, user interface this offline analytics button is not available.\n\nThe only way to configure and display any offline analytics for the DHIS2-RTS would be to configure a second \"dummy\" Tracker Program for the sole purpose of displaying offline analytics. But the user would have to close the DHIS2-RTS and open the \"dummy\" Tracker Program every time they want to consult any analytics.\n\n**Desired behaviour**\n\nBy default the user is able to toggle between the DHIS2-RTS user interface at any stage of any transaction and the offline analytics by selecting the same icons as already in use (see above).\n\nThe user is able to toggle between transactions and consulting the stock card easily and at any time with a single click.\n\nThis feature basically ensures parity between \"conventional\" Tracker Programs and the \"bespoke\" DHIS2-RTS and will in particular be needed, once the Line Listing is available in the offline analytics which is envisaged for 2.10.\n\n**As a DHIS2-RTS user (storkeepeer)**\n\n**When** - using the DHIS2-RTS for day-to-day work of recording stock transactions (stock receipt, distribution, discard and correction)\n\n**I want to** - review and analyze (recent) transactions on the mobile device, even if the local database was not (yet) synchronized with the central server and without having to open another application (such as using the PWA).\n\n**So I can** - immediately study (recent) transactions for my own work as well as providing customers with information on (recent) transactions.\n\n**Who faces this problem and how important is it to them?**\n\nAll storekeepers managing medical stores.

However this case is very unlikely and therefore not part of the business requirements (as differentiation would require to also store the manufacturer name of every batch which would greatly complicate the system)\n\n** Batches are always managed and represented in the chronological order of their expiry dates (the user does not have the possibility to change the order in the interface) with the batch number with the shortest remaining shelf live (nearest expiry date) being displayed first\n\n** In the exceptional case of more than one batch number for the same item and the same expiry date, the system will display those items in the alphabetical order of their batch numbers\n\n** FEFO (first-expiry first-out) management by definition requires to deplete the entire stock of any batch before taking any quantity from the next batch\n\n** The system automatically \"hides\" any batches with a \"Stock\" of zero.\n\n** Different manufacturers use different conventions for expiry dates for example only indicating the month and year or the day, month and year and in various formats (without separation or dots or slashes as separators). However, these inconsistencies are not a concern for DHIS2-RTS as the expiry date has to be uploaded into the system and must be GS1 DataMatrix code compatible at that stage (regardless of the electronic data which is being loaded into DHIS2, any necessary conversions must be done by the national eLMIS system)\n\n** In alignment with current DHIS2 conventions, expiry dates are presented in the format YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY (all indicated as numbers) depending on the \"Calendar settings\" of the DHIS2 \"System Settings\" app\n\n** Batch number fields are alphanumeric (numbers and letters), may contain special characters such as blank spaces, hyphens, dots etc. and allow up to 20 characters\n\n** By default, the user interface displays only a list of items and the total quantities in stock but without any details of batch numbers and expiry dates (as this would lead to extensively long lists and users never need a complete list of all batches / expiry dates at the same time)\n\n** The user does not have the possibility of \"expanding\" the entire item list to show the batch numbers and expiry dates for all items (instead the user has to select a single item)\n\n** When the user selects any specific item (by search or by scanning) the sublist with the batch numbers and expiry dates is always displayed automatically (but always only for a single item at a time)\n\n** When the users scrolls down the list and taps on any item, this single item is displayed together with the sublist of batch numbers and expiry dates (in the same way as when an item is selected by searching or scanning)\n\n** Items without batches are displayed only as a single line (as in the overview list)\n\n** When the user has completed selecting the required quantities for each batch number and expiry date, the user selects a new button \"Select new item\" which takes her/him back to the item list for selecting the next item\n\n** Batches which have expired cannot be selected by the user\n\n**User interface for items selected by searching, tapping or scanning**\n\nThe batch number(s) and expiry date(s) are added to each item as a sublist in the following way (illustration is indicative and will be aligned to DHIS2 Android conventions):\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|81,000| |\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|23,000| |\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|4,000| |\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|13,000| |\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|8,000| |\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|33,000| |\n\n** the \"Stock\" in the header row (indicating the item) indicates the total quantity in stock (corresponding and always being identical with the sum of the quantities of every batch)\n\n** the \"Stock\" next to each of the batch numbers / expiry dates indicates the quantity on hand for each of the respective batches.\n\n**Work flow**\n\nThe entire logic of the workflow remains the same but there is a significant change in that the user must first select a single item before being able to enter any quantities This change is made to avoid the need for displaying an endlessly long list of all items and batches as well as for preventing user errors which are more likely if the batch numbers and expiry dates of many items are displayed in the same interface. This change also improves the user experience as the item description will always appear at the top of the list with ample place to display the batch numbers and expiry dates (only for this one specific item).\n\nThe other significant changes is that the user still enters the total required quantity but the system automatically calculates a suggestion for the quantities of each batch number and expiry date the user should pick according to FEFO (but allows the user to \"override\" the recommended selection which should be very exceptional).\n\n*The additional steps required in the workflow for the batch number and expiry date management are indicated in italics and in red*.\n\nUser:\n\n** receives a written request from departments, services or community health workers indicating a list of healthcare products and their quantities which are requested and need to be prepared by the pharmacy\n** starts the mobile device\n** open the DHIS2-RTS mobile app\n** selects the transaction type \"Distribution\" [\"Discard\" or \"Correction\"]\n** selects the \"Organisation Unit\" (name of the healthcare facility) if s/he has access to more than one\n** selects the ward/service etc. which is requesting the goods and for which the order picking is carried out\n** selects the first item by scrolling and tapping on the item, searching or using the barcode scanner\n** *as soon as any item is selected, the user interface displays a single item with the sublist of batches and expiry dates [new]*\n** *if the user made a mistake s/he can revert back to the item list at any time by selecting the \"back\" button (arrow) at the top left of the screen (any quantities entered are lost)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *are blocked from entering any \"Quantity\" for batches which are expired*\n** *the \"Review\" button is displayed at the bottom of the screen*\n** *if the quantity entered by the user exceeds the total available quantity, an error message is displayed, the user is blocked from proceeding and must reduce the quantity*\n** *system calculates the quantities of each batch (starting with the first FEFO batch) until the required quantity is reached and indicates the quantity calculated for each batch number and expiry date in the \"Quantity\" field*\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|21,000|60000|\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|0|23,000|\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|0|4,000|\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|0|13,000|\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|0|8,000|\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|21,000|12,000|\n\n** *has the possibility of altering those quantities (but only up to the total of each batch, the user is not able to select quantities which lead to negative stocks)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field of the requested batch*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *if the user changes the \"Quantity\" for any of the batch numbers, the total \"Quantity\" for the item will adjust to that change*\n** *selects \"Select next item\" button at the bottom right*\n** proceeds to search for or scan the next item\n** selects the \"Review\" button (on the user interface with the complete list of items)\n** system opens the \"Review\" interface and displays the \"Confirm\" button\n** system displays only the items with the total quantities which were selected\n** *if the user requires to review details at the batch number and expiry date level during the review s/he selects one item (at a time) by searching, tapping or scanning*\n** *system shows the item code of the selected item in the search window and one item with all the selected batch numbers and expiry dates with the selected quantities*\n** *reverts to the \"Review\" user interface by tapping on the \"x\" in the search window*\n** *system shows the \"Review\" user interface (only with items and the total quantities selected)*\n** selects the \"Confirm\" button\n** system reverts to the DHIS2-RTS home screen\n** informs the requester to pick up the goods are delivers them to the requesting department/service\n\n**Issues to be resolved**\n\n** Batches with a \"Stock\" of zero are not displayed by the system but if a mistake was made and the user needs to enter a \"Correction\" batch numbers and expiry dates with a \"Stock\" of zero need to be displayed in case stock is found to actually not be zero. Displaying all batches which ever where in stock is not practical. Perhaps the last five batch numbers and expiry dates which were \"emptied\" can be displayed only in the \"Correction\" user interface.\n\n** Should items with batch numbers but without expiry dates be managed by FIFO?\n\nxxx\n\nCorrection on 25.01.2024\n\n** Every Tracked Entity is specified by an item code (mandatory) and item description (mandatory)\n- Individual batch numbers / expiry dates are created by multiple ‚Äúenrollments‚Äù of the same TEI (item) at the same OU. This has the advantage that in order to remove depleted batches (stock on hand = 0) individual enrollments can be ‚Äúhidden‚Äù using the native ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù functionality.",

This can be helpful if you are for example looking at all events assigned to you or available to you, but have access to several organisation units.\n\nDocumentation | Feature card | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3\n\n## üí≠ Problem definition\n\n### What problem or job are we going after?\n\nAfter selecting a program in capture app (specifically an event program, not a TEI), a user has the option to select to see all events accessible to them. When configuring items to see in the data view via settings, there is no options for ‚Äúregistering unit‚Äù. I‚Äôve noticed this is available for TEIs, but not for event programs. I know we can see registration units in line lists, or even click into the org unit hierarchy to see records associated with that unit, but I think it would still be useful to see the registering unit when viewing all events together.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\nCurrently, I work on a project that uses event programs in capture for 25 different districts and 5 provinces. Oftentimes, to do simple monitoring and checks, I‚Äôd rather see all events in a long list (including the registering unit), rather than clicking through each individual orgunit to see the events associated.\n\n### \n\n##",

For this reason, we are gradually enabling the possibility to customize it to each particular use case. In this version, the term \"event\" and \"enrollment\" are customizable. The admin user will be able to configure it for each program using the Maintenance App, and the Android Capture App will display the customized term instead of the generic one.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*customized*terminology)  | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image02.png) | [3](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image03.png) | [4](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-201-Image04.png)\n\nSupport the posibility to configure certain tracker terminology to provide a more contextualized user experience.

The global shell will ensure consistent headerbar and command pallet as well as other common global functionality such as alerts, session management, and more.\n\nOptional support for a global app shell has been released in DHIS2 v41.  By default, web applications are served independently.  However, an application with the name ‚Äúglobal-app-shell‚Äù can be optionally installed and will subsequently be served instead of individual web applications.  All applications, both bundled and installed, will be harmonized and served from the {{/apps}} path, rather than for example {{/dhis-web-dashboard}} or {{/api/apps/my-app}}.  Accessing apps at their previous paths will redirect the user to the new location.\n\nAs a fallback, apps can be accessed directly at their old locations by appending the {{?redirect=false}} query paramenter.  For example, the app management app can be accessed directly from the browser at {{/dhis-web-app-management/index.html?redirect=false}} - this is useful for uninstalling a misbehaving global app shell, for example.",

It is designed to emphasize trends in data over a time period, but in a more smooth, gradual way than a line chart does. Spline charts are a clear, easy way to provide a graphical representation of one or more time-dependent variables.\n\nA new chart type should be introduced called Spline chart.

It would be very useful to make it easier for users to find the dashboard/information they are looking for if a superuser could group dashboards together so that they appear as a single entity at the top of the screen, and when clicked worked something like the organization unit hierarchy. I can think of examples where multiple layers maybe used, something like groups and group sets, but even a single layer of grouping would be useful.",

For example with the DHIS2 for education implementation in Uganda, we are working on departmental dashboards pulling data from one single tool - the termly tool. We would therefore like to have a dashboard label for Termly Tool data and then below have various tabs to navigate the different pages under there such as school health, school feeding etc. Example below:\n\nThis is how the dashboards currently are. We had to create individual dashboards for each of the departments which are pulling data from the same tool.\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\nThis here is what we suggest, is it possible for us to have a single dashboard but within there, one can have tabs through which a user can navigate to view the different categories of data.\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01 (1).png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01.png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!dashboard tabs (1).jpg|width=1640,height=924!\n\n!dashboard tabs.jpg|width=1640,height=924!",

Configurability tracked entity attribute based searches with sensible defaults: Tracked entity attributes needs to specify which search type that is a good default when users are searching using that tracked entity attribute. Which method is default is an indication that the Capture app, Android capture app and other custom clients should use this operator as the preferred operator for search. This default MAY also be enforced, if the default is enforced, the API will reject any searches with other operators for the given tracked entity attribute.\n## The default is defined in the Maintenance app, and stored on the tracked entity attribute, and will be interpreted by the clients.\n## The LIKE operator is the one most likely to cause slow performing queries(first observed profiling the Rwanda EPI instance but also match expectation). Therefore the maintenance app will pre-select EQUALS or other suiting operators if the user does not make an explicit choice of search operator.\n1.

      "description": "In some use cases, users will be faster if they can use speech-to-text to record their data. The use case reporting this request is the real time stock monitoring, where users scan a product and say outloud the number of items on stock. Other use cases might need to be considered if this is implemented. Application might be restricted to integer numbers.\n\n{panel:bgColor=#deebff}\n**LMIS USE CASE**\n\n**Current behaviour**\n\nThe BAO-systems RTS app (developed in 2021) already included a fully functional speech-to-text entry option but this feature was not included in the DHIS2-RTS version. One reason was that the Google (?) speech engine which BAO-systems used is not compatible with DHIS2 development standards. Nevertheless, BAO-systems did demonstrate the feasibility of integrating this feature into a DHIS2 mobile application. The screenshot below indicates the red microphone ready to record the quantity.\n\n!image-20240107-182023.png|width=712,height=413!\n\nUsers currently enter data by scanning barcodes and entering data with an onscreen keyboard which is displayed when prompted. While the DHIS2-RTS is far more efficient than paper-based sytems, it is still not ideal as the user has to:\n\n** pick up a mobile device which always requires using both hands (and putting anything else down)\n\n** open the DHIS2-RTS mobile application\n\n** select the \"scan\" icon (which requires both hands)\n\n** scan a bar code (which requires one hand for a mobile phone or both hands for a tablet computer)\n\n** enter the quantity on the mobile device through the onscreen keyboard (again requiring the use of both hands)\n\n** lay down the mobile device (alternatively hanging it around her/his neck)\n\n** physically pick and count the healthcare goods and place them on a trolley\n\n** pickup up the mobile device again etc.\n\nIn principle the mobile device is only needed for scanning a barcode and entering a quantity and it is not practical to manipulate, especially larger tablet computers, just for scanning a small barcode and then typing a few digits.\n\nTyping numbers all day is tedious and prone to errors and far slower than speaking them.\n\nThis innovation would allow healthcare facilities in LMICs to leapfrog technological developments and use modern stock management systems found in most commercial stores around the world (including in LMICs).\n\nSpeech-recognition was invented by the Bell Labs in 1952 with transcription of simple numbers and is a well established technology and has been widely popularized with Siri (2010), Alexa (2014) and Google Assistant (2016).\n\n\"Voice directed warehousing operations\" was introduced in the early 1990s and is a well established technology in commercial warehouses. Note that unlike commercial settings, in the context of using DHIS2 for medical stocks, an electronic record of the order is not available and will be managed from a paper record (while a commercial system would also \"read\" the required items one by one and direct the user which item to pick).\n\n**Desired behaviour**\n\nThe overal objective of this feature is allowing the \"handsfree\" use of the DHIS2-RTS mobile application which requires two components:\n\n** connection of a small handheld or finger mounted barcode reader (see JIRA ticket \n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-5097](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-5097) +)+ which allows users to use both of their hands for order picking (retrieving healthcare products from the shelf, counting them and placing them on a trolley) rather than blocking at least one hand for manipulating the mobile device for scanning barcodes and requiring both hands for typing quantities\n\n** speech-to-text data entry and text-to-speech synthesis for reading text outload\n\nThese two components would allow the user to place a Tablet PC on the trolley (strapping on the wrist etc.) used for picking the healthcare goods, opening the DHIS2-RTS on the mobile device but then entering data without having to use the mobile device at all.\n\nThe speech-to-text functionality actually has three separate and distinct features:\n\n** recognition of wake words (voice commands for operating and navigating through the DHIS2-RTS app such as \"Scan\" and \"Enter\")\n\n** speech-recognition of numbers for recording the selected quantities\n\n** text-to-speech functionality for \"reading back\" entered data\n\n**Desired workflow**\n\nThe user takes a paper record with an order (filled in on a printed form or an informal list), goes to the medical store and:\n\n** switches on the mobile device\n\n** authenticates in the DHIS2 Capture Android app\n\n** opens the DHIS2-RTS application\n\n** activates the voice recognition mode\n\n** selects the transaction type (if needed as \"Distribution\" appears by default)\n\n** selects the Organisation Unit (if needed as most users will be assigned to a single OU)\n\n** selects \"Deliver to\" (name of the ward or service such as operating theatre or surgical ward)\n\n** places the mobile device safely in a cradle on trolley (to prevent falling and damage)\n\n** dones a bluetooth ring barcode scanner which is connected to the mobile device\n\n** dones a microphone which is connected to the mobile device\n\n*For each item to be picked*\n\n** says \"Scan\": DHIS2-RTS activates the barcode scanner\n\n** scans the barcode: DHIS2-RTS selects the item in the list, opens the field for entering the quantity and \"listens\" to the user\n\n** says \"two thousand\" (for example or whatever quantity is required) and \"Enter\" (to confirm completion of the quantity): DHIS2-RTS converts the speech into text and writes it into the data field and reads back the entry, for example \"Paracetamol, 500 mg, tabs, two thousand\"\n\n** in case the recorded quantity exceeds the available stock on hand, the speech engine will say \"maximum quantity [maximum]\" and the user has to reduce the quantity to the available maximum\n\n** etc. until the last item is picked\n\n** selects \"Review\" button, double-checks the order picking by comparing the selected quantities with the recorded quantities\n\n** if necessary, makes corrections manually\n\n** confirms the order picking\n\n** de-activates the voice recognition mode\n\nIn case mistakes are made, the user will have to make corrections manually (as otherwise there would be endless options of different workflows) as the objective is to facilitate the \"happy path\" assuming mistakes are rare.\n\n**Functional requirements**\n\n** applies only to the \"Distribution\" transaction (as the \"Discard\" and \"Correction\" transaction must be rare and it is not worthwhile to customize details to them as they will be used only rarely)\n\n** button which allows the user to activate or deactivate the voice recognition functionality\n\n** development for the main languages English, Spanish, French, Russian and Arabic\n\n** recognition of \"wake words\" for \"Scan\" and \"Enter\" and effecting the corresponding navigation in the DHIS2-RTS mobile application\n\n** speech-to-text conversion of the spoken quantity\n\n** speech functionality for example for announcing errors (such as when the maximum quantity is exceeded)\n{panel}",

      "description": "## Release Notes Description\n\n**New Capture Coordinates process:**  Introducing new features designed to enhance the capture coordinates process. These improvements aim to provide greater accuracy, flexibility, and control over location data capture.\n\n** **Accuracy:** The capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time. This parameter can also be restricted using the Android Settings WebApp.\n** **Search Functionality:** A new search functionality has been added, allowing users to look up specific locations by name or address. Users are also able to navigate through the map and perform area searches to discover other locations within a specified region. \n** **Block Manual Capture:* Using the Android Settings Web App, administrators now have the option to block manual location capture. When this setting is enabled, users can only capture the current location and cannot manually select or search a different one. This ensures that location data remains consistent and accurate.\n\n[+Jira+](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-6330) | [+Release card 1+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-disabled-manual-capture.png) | [+Release card 2+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-accuracy.png) | [+Release card 3+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-search.png) | [+Documentation1+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*map*accuracy) +|+ [+Documentation 2+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/settings-configuration.html#capture*app*android*settings*webapp*appearance*program*specific)\n\n## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nThe Android App needs to display the current accuracy in the coordinates selector when capturing current location. This provides a helpful prompt to recapture if the accuracy is low. Without this visual indicator, users capture very inaccurate coordinates without realizing. \n\nThis need applies to any coordinate capture using the mobile app - Enrollment, Event and data element coordinates.\n\nThis will provide much-needed accuracy to community-level data capturing. which will ensure improved quality of geo coordinates especially at the household level. overall, good accuracy improves quality of data entry at the community level.\n\n## :people*holding_hands: Users description\n\nHelpful in urban and rural environments across multiple users and teams (EPI, bed nets, deliveries, entomology sentinel sites) and associated varied devices. Translates to cleaner map visuals for all MOH levels, partners, funders.\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nWhen users are collecting coordinates with their mobile phone, the accuracy of the actual coordinates is not displayed in the user interface. However, GPS coordinates can be extremely inaccurate, but we know that accuracy improves with time or if the user captures coordinate 2-3 times. \n\nThe GPS feature currently is not trustworthy, and users need to confirm their GPS location as sometimes the signal is not very strong, resulting in inaccurate data capture. \n\nWithout displaying accuracy information, it is very easy to just tap it and forget about whether the reading is accurate or not. Users are constantly capturing inaccurate GPS coordinates, simply because they are not getting visual feedback to re-capture. Displaying the accuracy will allow implementers to train users on leveraging this information to try capturing a few more times to let the accuracy increase .\n\nIn door to door data collection deliveries and sometimes the coordinates don't come as accurate as users don't have idea of the accuracy then collecting the coordinates.",

      "description": "## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nIndividuals and community members are active participants in their own health and the health of their communities.Empowering individuals to report on their own health data through mobile solutions enables more *robust data collection* and facilitates *task shifting* among the health workforce. Health workers‚Äô time traditionally spent on data collection & reporting can be reallocated to improve data analysis and patient-centered care. Finally, self-reporting and feedback loops can expand the reach of health interventions and data systems to individuals who face barriers accessing health facilities.¬†\n\nSelf monitoring implies that patients can access their own health record and consult and update their own health data. In some cases patinents will only need to see their data wihtout need to edit. \n\nThis use case is extended here> [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136) \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nPatients that are already registered in a health program.\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nIn some cases / health programs patients are in really remote areas and having health staff monitoring them is not feasible, not even community health staff. Some programs requiere dayli upadtes and patients are requested to keep track of themselves and then, weekly or bi-weekley, when visited by a health worker they report all that information that is in many cases forgotten or not well recorded. Visits of this nature also take  alot of time.\n\nIn other cases, for example an epidemic, even if patinets are reachable, is simply not manageable to monitor them on daily basis, or not recommended for infectious risks. \n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nThe patient is already regitsered in the system.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nThis use case was already studied during covid. The source are many inputs from the community. \n\nReference douments from that study can be found here: \n\n** [Self reporting concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGMxHg*02UaJvpnPldRJ2uBBlK2UsyibPiwjXC*JGQg/edit#heading=h.midsb1pv3ak1)\n** [Self reporting user stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cB0YP*tS0ZL4wdaJQSN1wuDo*SLj6R9tO-LnaehBXiQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nSelf reporting could be addressed at different levels (see below). This Idea is refering to number 5. Self monitoring. The other use casesa re out of scope.\n\n1. Self assessment: mobile tools that enable an individual to make a self-assessment about whether he/she has COVID-10 symptoms\n1. Self reporting of aggregate/non-identifiable data: these user stories included mass surveys for individuals to report in whether or not they have COVID-19-like symptoms; only aggregate data are captured primarily for public health analytics purposes\n1. Self-identification: an individual is ‚Äúunknown‚Äù to the health care system and make themself known through software (e.g. Tanzania hotline: individual calls hotline and phone number is pushed to DHIS2 event program through USSD solution for follow up\n1. Self-registration: an individual records their own details to ease the burden of the health workers on registration (e.g. a patient ‚Äòself enrolls‚Äô into a suspected COVID-19 case program\n1. Self-monitoring: an individual has had contact with the health system to be enrolled into some sort of longitudinal monitoring program, but they submit data themselves during the course of follow up period (e.g. an individual is registered into DHIS2 program by a CHW as a contact of a confirmed case and submit updates everyday for 14 days about whether or not they have developed symptoms)\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|How will patinets identify/authenticate themselves?| | |",

Some examples include looking up demographic information from an external client registry / looking up terminologies from a terminology service / etc.\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nThis request can already be solved on web only with tracker data entry plugins (v41) and the routes API (v40).  However, the request remains to solve this more generically through configuration (define an API lookup including query parameters and response mappings.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nPAHO, WHODrug, ICD-11, KS\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nExternal APIs will not work offline, so we will need to have some fallback\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

Backend supports merging the following metadata objects through the web API: Organisation Units, Data Elements, Indicators, Indicator Types, Category options, Category option combinations (limited to one use case, when the Category option combinations are the same). Frontend support through the user interface is gradually implemented as well. So far the new Maintenance app supports merging options for Category options, Indicators and Indicator types. In these cases the user is able to select the ‚Äúsource‚Äù object to merge and the ‚Äútarget‚Äù object to merge references to.\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/develop/using-the-api/dhis-core-version-master/metadata.html#webapi*indicator*merge) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/42/42-configure-metadata-deduplication.png) | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3",

We are looking for a functionality where the vaccinator is only able to enter event data (Capture, Event without Registration), without the possibility of being able to delete or edit other data.¬†\nOne caveat would be that the vaccinator would need to be able to edit/delete their own data (in the case that they make a mistake), but should not be able to delete the data of their peers. Multiple vaccinators would work within the same Org Unit, so it would not be possible to restrict access to a specific Org Unit. The vaccination teams would also travel to multiple Org Units.\nThe reason we want this is that the project managers should control and monitor the vaccination process. Vaccination data should not need changing, unless user error (such as selecting the incorrect Org Unit when in the field) comes into play. The project manager should be able to identify this and identify the user for additional training. Furthermore, as the vaccinators only receive basic training, we do not want them to be able to mistakenly delete records or edit those that others may have entered.¬†\n** **Deleting:** [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-341](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ROADMAP-341) Context: we are using the DHIS2 capture app. On the web form, users shouldn't have the option to delete an event in active or completed status.

To make a Dashboard app to set  default filters for each newly created dashboards. In other words: each dashboard should be able created with some default filters(OU, period, dataDimensions etc.) configuration, so it could be saved and lately applied immediately when the dashboards shown.\nIn this case we could make custom settings for each dashboard, with filters or any other features inside then save it. \n1. Ability to apply default filters to the dashboard\n1. ability import/export those default filter settings as metadata  \n\nThis functionality could be very helpful, when a user wants to show the same reports/charts/tables on  different dashboards for different period or OUs, countries. \n\nThank you\n\nRegards, \n\nUlanbek",

However, it has been identified that this approach can lead to inaccurate figures in EMIS, as weekends and public holidays should ideally be excluded from the calculation. Especially when you are collecting daily attendance data. As a consequence completeness rate can never be 100% eventhough data has been collected all the school days. Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Improved accuracy of completion rate calculations, providing more meaningful insights into attendance patterns.\n1. Better alignment of completion rate calculations with actual attendance data.\n1.

      "description": "Hello,\n\nThe new indicator Year-to-date functionality is very interesting, and we could use the [periodInYear] item available for Program related calculations as well.\n\nUse case: Our country teams previously captured follow-up with clients in Excel, with one column for each month. We‚Äôve structured a DHIS2 tracker program stage in a similar way, to make it easier for users. There is one BOOLEAN DE for each month, and the peer navigator can check the box for the month if they verified everything with the client in the given month. This makes it so that they only have to create one event each fiscal year, and they can really easily query which clients haven‚Äôt been followed up in the given month. However, its more difficult for indicator calculations, because we need a way of saying ‚ÄúIf the period is March, check if March==Yes; else if the period is April, check if April==Yes‚Ä¶.‚Äù\n\nIf we could have a periodInYear item, it could make this much simpler.\n\nIdeally, we would also like a period in fiscal year item, as we work with an October FY. But period in Year could work as well.\n\nThere is a similar use case for Program Rules.. in this case we could restrict data entry in months that are in the future.",

At the moment, this is typically handled by adding multiple additional data element or attributes, where one of them is called e.g. \"Other\" and with a free text \"Specify\" attribute/element to hold the free text. While the latter method is OK where you have a multi-choice list, it is a pain where you have a single attribute or data element with an option set.\n\nNote: in e.g. MS Access, this would be similar to the \"Limit to list y/n\" attribute for data fields - you can specify if only optionsetvalues are allowed or else if not then you can select from a drop-down OR enter free text).\n{quote}",

That means, tables can only be sorted by a single attribute at a time.\n\n**Use case**\n\nThe Line Listing will be the primary analytics application used by storekeepers for the DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management application) which is currently under development. Typically, storekeepers would like to apply multiple, cascading filters for routine analysis:\n\n1. filter level: transaction date\n\n1. filter level: \"Deliver to\" destination (ward or service)\n\n1. filter level: item description\n\nor\n\n1. filter level: \"Deliver to\" destination (ward or service)\n\n1. filter level: item description\n\n1. filter level: transaction date\n\netc.\n\nOne alternative could also be that, by default, any Line Listing is sorted in ascending order of all attributes from the left (1. filter level) to the right (last filter level) whenever a Line Listing report is opened.\n\n**Desired behaviour**\n\nThe required workflow is:\n\n** User opens the Line Listing application\n\n** User selects the sort icon (small triangle) for the first attribute: the table is sorted by that column\n\n** User selects the sort icon (small triangle) for the second attribute: the sorting of the first attribute is maintained and within identical rows (of the first attribute) the second attribute is sorted in ascending order\n\n** User selects the sort icon (small triangle) for the third attribute: the sorting of the first and second attribute are maintained and within identical rows (of the first and second attribute) the third attribute is sorted in ascending order\n\n- User has the option to remove the filter from any of the attributes: any filters set for any other attributes are maintained in the same filter level order as initially configured\n\nThis feature is commonly available in spreadsheet applications.

      "description": "**Background**\n\nThe Line Listing will be the primary analytics tool for the DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management) which is currently under development. Storekeepers will record dozens or hundreds of transactions for about 100 to 300 different TEIs (items, health care products). Storekeepers will often want to view a transaction history of a specific health care product (TEI) and frequently switch from one to another TEI.\n\n**Current behaviour**\n\nThe Line Listing app allows sorting columns (ascending and descending) simply by clicking on the up/down arrows in the header. So instead of filtering for a TEI, the user could sort the attribute and then scroll down the list until finding the TEI of interest. However, given the large number of transactions every day, users will have to scroll a lot which is not convenient on a (small) mobile device.\n\nUsers can also filter for any specific TEI in any of the attributes but this requires several clicks for setting as well as for every change:\n\n** Click on dimension\n\n** \"Add a condition\"\n\n** Select \"exactly\" as condition\n\n** Type the TEI attribute name: this step is particularly time consuming and inconvenient, particularly on a mobile device\n\n** Update\n\n**Desired behaviour**\n\nThis feature is primarily needed on mobile devices (once the Line Listing is available in the off-line in-app Local Analytics)\n\nIdeally, the selection should be possible with a single (or small number) of clicks on a mobile device:\n\n** User opens the Line Listing dashboard\n\n- User identifies the dimension (attribute) \"Item description\"\n\n1. click: User clicks on the header: a drop-menu appears at the top of the screen\n\n1. click: User selects the required TEI: the drop-down menu closes and the filter is applied\n\nThis enhancement would allow to select and filter for any item with only two clicks (one for selecting the header and a second for selecting the TEI).",

      "description": "**Background**\n\nGavi and UNICEF have made furnishing of secondary vaccine packaging with GS1 DataMatrix codes mandatory for all vaccine manufacturers from the beginning of 2022. While there are no (known) plans to replace (or complement) GS1 DataMatrix codes by (with) RFID tags, UNICEF has been exploring the use of RFID tags at least since 2008:\n\n[https://magazine.jhsph.edu/2009/fall/news*briefs/a*jewel*for*disease*tracking/](https://magazine.jhsph.edu/2009/fall/news*briefs/a*jewel*for*disease*tracking/) \n\nAnd, the potential benefits of unit pack level RFID tags are enormous, almost too good to be true:\n\n** In principle a RFID multi-reader would allow a storekeeper to walk through a store or warehouse with a mobile device and carry out a complete physical stock count without having to count or manipulate a single individual unit packs.\n\n** A RFID multi-reader installed at the door of a pharmacy would allow a storekeeper to simply pass through a basket with several unit packs of health care products and DHIS2 automatically recording the stock transaction as well as the (re-)calculating the stock on hand and prompting automated replenishment orders.\n\n** The capability for reading RFID tags has other potentials such as marking baskets with the name of the ward/service receiving a consignment and including this data in the DHIS2 stock transaction record\n\n** Smart refrigerators could keep track of their contents as well as all transactions without any human record, simply by placing vaccines in and removing them from the refrigerator and Gavi/UNICEF could locate any (counterfeit) serialized unit pack simply by querying a database\n\nTherefore, although use of the technology depends on manufacturers furnishing unit packs with RFID tags, the request is intended to be prepared for rapidly approaching technologies and be able to offer Gavi/UNICEF a tool as soon as they implement this technology.\n\nIn 2020, 90% of mobile phones shipped by manufacturers were NFC-enabled (near field communication) and this technology was implemented in only a decade.\n\nConsidering that the actual NFC (near field communication) capability and reading of data is available natively on nearly all new mobile phones, the DHIS2 development is limited to \"importing\" this data for further processing.\n\n**Current behaviour**\n\nDHIS2 allows data entry through key boards or by scanning a range of different barcodes. Barcodes have the disadvantage that they can only be entered one by one and that a camera has to be pointed at a barcode from the correct distance, at the correct angle and under specific lighting conditions. GS1 DataMatrix codes measure only a few millimetres and are particularly cumbersome to read.\n\n**Use case**\n\nA storekeeper picking several serialized products (where each unit pack is identified by the manufacturer with its own and unique ID):\n\n** scans the unit packs one by one by passing the RFID tag over the mobile device-device, or\n\n** places all unit packs in a bin and passes the mobile device over the bin (or the bin over the mobile device)\n\n** DHIS2 reads out the data of each RFID tag and stores it on the mobile device in memory\n\n** DHIS2 processes the data further (in the same way as if it had been entered by a keyboard, barcode reader or from a Bluetooth device)\n\nRFID tags have the following advantages:\n\n** Readout by passing them over a mobile device is easier and faster than using a barcode scanner and does not depend on lighting conditions\n\n** Using special RFID tag multi-readers, many RFID tags can be read out simultaneously by passing a mobile device near them rather than having to handle each unit pack separately. This greatly facilitates and speeds up data processing.",

A patient is put on treatment and has to receive specific medication regularly.\n\nThe events of medication distribution should be recorded. They are used to calculate and validate the stock. A list of medications can be quite long but will likely not change from each distribution event.\nCreating a ‚ÄúDUPLICATE EVENT‚Äù button will save the enduser a lot of time and will make the work more efficient.\n\n1. A patient needs to be monitored every month. Depending on the diagnosis, specific tests and checks will be performed repeatedly during the process. Giving the user an option to duplicate event and possibly editing certain fields rather than filling in every event manually will improve the efficiency of data entry.\n\n1.

Currently they need to compare previous events or stages to fill in the same dataelements in the new event (also note that the compare feature was removed in the new capture app which makes it more difficult also.",

      "description": "Within events, the way these are aggregated in time within a Line List is essentially just a window in which all existing events are returned.\r\n\r\nHowever it can actually be helpful to do a form of aggregation (or perhaps more accurately \"filtering\") within the time dimension. The new feature I am suggesting would do just that -¬†**within the selected time period, the user should be able to further filter to show just the first, and/or, just the last (most recent) event for their selection.**¬†Since it is \"time\" being filtered to first or last, it will be important for the user to know/decide which dimension is being filtered.¬†\r\n\r\nFor example, in the table below, 4 events for one org unit. But the org unit has two attribute options also.¬†Is the FIRST or LAST selection filtering for the first or last of all 4 events based on the OU or AOC? If filtering the OU it would be event 4 alone; if filtering the Option then two events would be last, (Option 1, Event 3) and (Option 2, Event 4). Similarly for additional dimensions.\r\n|OU|AOC|Date|Event||\r\n|District A|Option 1|Jan 1, 22|1|\r\n|District A|Option 2|Feb 1, 22|2|\r\n|District A|Option 1|Mar 1, 22|3|\r\n|District A|Option 2|Apr 1, 22|4|\r\n\r\nHow could this work?\r\n # The user would select the program dimensions and report date in line listing as usual...\r\n\r\n!image-2022-06-01-12-49-44-400.png!\r\n\r\n2. There would be an extra option for filterable dimension - organisation unit, and \"your dimensions\" - which would be available to select \"Filter events for... \"First\" or \"Last\". This could be added to the dialogue box that appears when selecting each dimension.¬†\r\n\r\n!image-2022-08-19-15-48-02-503.png!\r\n\r\nIn situations where there are no events - no events would be returned as usual.\r\n\r\nIn situations where the first and last events are the same in the period - just the one event is returned.\r\n\r\n¬†\r\n\r\nWhy is this useful?\r\n ** To be able to compare at an immediate glance (without having to visually ignore intervening events) the status of a particular location for a program at the beginning and end of a period. i.e. to see the change\r\n ** To be able to perform that rudimentary aggregation. Sometimes all the events throughout a year are not important, and it is just the final event which matters. This is because this final event is representative of the status of the location at the end of the year and is what is reported on. And whilst LAST and FIRST can be achieved in a pivot table, this is¬†*not*¬†helpful where there is a need to show program indicators alongside¬†*text value type*¬†event data elements as is only possible in a line list.¬†\r\n * As a result you are able to return just a single desired event for a location rather than all events.",

      "description": "On occasion it would be highly useful to be able to change DHIS2 internal logging levels on the fly without having to stop, reconfigure, and restart the server.\n\nSometimes there is an abnormal condition on a production server that we would like to learn more about. Indeed, just the act of restarting the server might clear the problem.\n\nWe request three features:\n\n1. A WebAPI GET request, available for superusers only, that returns in alphabetical order all the current loggers in the system, and the current level of each. We understand there are currently between 800 and 900 loggers in the running system. The request could return the following format, or its equivalent:\n\n{code:java}[\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"Hibernate Types\",\r\n        \"level\": \"WARN\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"com.mchange.v1.db.sql.ConnectionUtils\",\r\n        \"level\": \"WARN\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"com.mchange.v2.async.ThreadPoolAsynchronousRunner\",\r\n        \"level\": \"WARN\"\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n]{code}\n\n2. A WebAPI PUT request, also available for superusers only, that allows the user to specify a fully-qualified logger name (as returned in the above GET statement) and a valid log level (e.g., \"WARN\", \"INFO\", \"ERROR\", etc.). The logger would be set to that level, and a response returned that indicates whether or not the operation succeeded.\n\n3. A way to disable or enable the above two features in the dhis.conf file. (A single setting to turn both features on or off would suffice, or it could be a setting that also allows the GET without the PUT in addition to both on or both off.)\n\nA case could be made either way as to whether the feature should default to \"on\" or \"off\". We believe that many support people would like this feature on by default if the installation has not taken the extra step to configure this one way or the other. To best support these support people, we recommend that the feature be set to \"on\" by default.",

      "description": "Hello!\r\n\r\nFor the new tracker import endpoint where it is possible to trigger the program rules on the program (which is very cool, by the way) it would be super helpful to be able to selectively choose which rules to trigger based upon the action.\r\n\r\nThis would mean including a parameter in the post request like \"triggerAction= \" (though obviously call it whatever makes sense) and then be able to array all rule actions required to trigger (i.e. those listed in the [docs](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-237/configuring-the-system/programs.html#create*program*rule)).¬†\r\n\r\nSo for example, triggerAction=assignValue,showError - would trigger only the assign value and trigger error rules at import.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use-case?¬†\r\n\r\nWe have programs which have plenty of skip logic for hide fields - accounting for about 90% of the PRs. The other 10% are show warning, show error, assign value, or mandatory field. We are attempting to import 1000s of events for these programs at once, and the data was completed in such a way that we know the front-end relevant hide/show logic has been respected. When importing currently on a very large server, and parsing events in chunks, the CPU usage spikes (or crashes); whereas turning off the PRs on these programs solves the issue - but is not a reasonable fix. It also appears the tracker import is attempting to trigger all the hide fields logics to test they're being respected; but as noted, this is largely irrelevant. By being able to selectively trigger rule actions it will help reduce server burden and speed up the process of import - which will be a routine (i.e. monthly in >20 countries) process.",

      "description": "Currently the ability to build a legend set through the DHIS2 UI is restricted to the Maintenance App (other module.)¬†\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit odd, initially, because most/all users should perform analysis and therefore all should have the ability to build custom legends; however very few users should be accessing the maintenance app for system configuration tasks. So currently to build a legend set you need two authorities:\r\n ** Create legend set\r\n ** See Maintenance App\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a way to be able to create legend sets with only the first \"Create legend set\" authority by making it possible to create legend sets¬†*within*¬†the analytic apps.\r\n\r\nI understand that as a metadata object, the most sensible place is to house legend sets as an object in the maintenance app as a home, but the suggestion would then be that - whilst they reside in the maintenance app - they can be created in the maintenance and the analytic apps.¬†\r\n\r\nThis would:\r\n ** Need the ability to create, rename, update, share and delete legends through the analytic apps\r\n ** Enable the Maintenance App to be masked from the majority of users and avoid a troublesome use/training exercise for having to introduce the maintenance app, tell people to ignore most of its features, create a legend set and then return to the analysis apps.\r\n * Have the added benefit of decluttering the apps menu\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have a use-case where we want users to have certain metadata creation abilities without knowing it. An example, they can create indicators through a custom app without knowing that's what they're doing. However if the maintenance app is visible, there is a chance they stumble across the ability to create indicators (which, admittedly they could do via the api also.) But being able to hide the Maintenance App from them (which we would have to show if the only way to create a legend is through the maintenance app) means the chances of doing so are reduced.",

      "description": "The advent of the \"text pattern\" for tracked entity attributes was a big win for the generation of auto-generated IDs based upon a pre-defined pattern. The new feature of this ticket requests the ability to auto-generate IDs through tracker domain type data elements, as well.\n\nThis is because it can often be useful to auto-generate an ID in event programs (or certain program stages of a tracker program) where data elements are in play, and not TEA.\n\nUse-cases:\n\n** In NTD programming, an auto-generated ID is used per event (survey) to designate an ID to the particular survey¬†*and*¬†another ID to a particular survey moment. (For example a planned survey gets an ID, and if it is carried out as intended it receives the same ID again. Whereas if that survey gets delayed, perhaps because of COVID, the survey moment ID is generated anew and would be different to the original.)\n** In certain event programs where individuals are measured, they may require a random case ID.\n** I'm sure there are plenty more, but they escape me right now üòâ\n\n**Other Jira sources:**\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-1994](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-1994) \nCurrently, only Tracked Entity Attributes can be configured to be auto-generated and possibly unique values (see separate JIRA issues for specifications of pattern-defined case values).\n\nA similar type of Data Element is urgently required for Disease Surveillance, where you typically set up a \"Contact Tracing\" (tracking people who has been exposed to a pathogen or an infected individual) stage to store names, address, phone numbers etc for contacts being traced and monitored. Each such contact will have a unique Contract Tracing ID.\n\nNOTE in this context that whereas we CAN use a \"Child Program\" for tracking contacts, we find it's better to use a repeatable stage for it - mainly due to the very limited options in DHIS2 for analysing data from multiple programs.\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-19558](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-19558) \n\nWe are implementing a Birth Notification program using a **DHIS2 Event Program**. However, we have identified a key limitation: unlike Tracker Programs, Event Programs do not support the use of a **unique identifier per event instance** that can be referenced independently across systems or used for tracking individual submissions over time.\n\nIn our use case, it is crucial to associate each birth notification event with a **globally unique identifier**, similar to the {{Tracked Entity Instance UID}} in Tracker Programs. This UID would facilitate:\n\n** **Interoperability**: Enable linkage with other systems (e.g., CRVS, HMIS, or Civil Registration) through consistent identifiers.\n** **Data reconciliation**: Allow deduplication or merging of data based on the unique ID.\n** **Audit and traceability**: Provide a consistent reference for follow-up or verification processes.\n\n**Suggested Implementation:**\n\n** Introduce an optional **auto-generated UID** field for Event Program instances.\n** Alternatively, allow configuration of a custom unique identifier field (using program-stage data elements) with enforcement of uniqueness.\n** Ensure this UID is exposed via API endpoints and UI views (e.g., Event Reports, Event Capture).\n** Ideally, support integration with identifier generation strategies (e.g., UID, UUID, sequential number with prefix).\n\n**Use Case Context:**\n\n** **Country**: South Sudan\n** **Program**: Birth Notification (Event Program)\n** **Challenge**: Current design lacks a persistent reference ID, creating challenges in referencing events externally.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n** A unique identifier can be auto-generated or configured in an Event Program.\n** Identifier is accessible via API, UI, and exports.\n** The identifier behaves similarly to Tracked Entity Instance UID in terms of persistence and uniqueness.",

So, if an annual data set is chosen and data is entered in the current period (2021), and -6 months is chosen, then the selected cells would lock in June 2021 (i.e. -6 months from the end of the period)\r\n\r\nAdditionally a user authority to override the lock.\r\n\r\n**Within an event/tracker program:**\r\n\r\nA program rule action should be created to \"lock value\" - which would mean a value is locked should a user go back to edit an event at a later date. This could be triggered using an expression like \"d2:daysBetween(V\\{event*date},V\\{current*date}...)\r\n\r\nAgain, the same user authority should allow the override of this lock.\r\n\r\n***Use-case:***\r\n\r\nIn NTD programming, Work planning is carried out to define which EUs within a Country should have a survey or not. Given extenuating circumstances a planned survey may be cancelled or postponed. For example, in a COVID year like 2020. It is important to know when the survey was postponed or cancelled but the original planned date of the survey should not change. There needs to be a window of time to allow the planning to occur, but after 3 months of the planned year have passed, it should not be possible to change the planned survey date; but rather the date should \"lock in\" and the actual survey date should be used. (Users have a habit of wanting to get hteir planned and actual dates aligned and so edit both.)",

So, each time any piece of metadata is updated, they are having many issues that get resolved when a cache clean is done.\r\n\r\nKnowing that we cannot force a cache clean on our users, I was thinking something like an alert or a pop-up could be implemented. So when a user is seeing by the first time a new version of a program or a dataset, DHIS2 propose/recommends the user to perform a cache-clean, or even forbids the access before a cache clean has been done.\r\n\r\nThis could be set at program/dataset level, or at a usergroup level.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

It would be very useful to make it easier for users to find the dashboard/information they are looking for if a superuser could group dashboards together so that they appear as a single entity at the top of the screen, and when clicked worked something like the organization unit hierarchy.

Is it possible to make Constants part of \"Program dependency\"?\r\nCurrently, if we use constants in program rules or program indicators, the export does not check whether constants are referenced in the program.\r\n\r\n2. Apart from using constants in a way that is currently described in the documentation, constants are currently used to configure generic packages.\r\nExample: Generic tracker program offers a program stage for laboratory testing and includes 3 various tests organised into sections. Country A uses all tests (1,2,3) while country B uses only 2 tests (1,2). Country \"B\" changes the value of a constant and a program rule hides the section 3 from data entry forms. If country B starts using test 3 at some point, they can just change the value of a constant. This way, there is no need to delete/recreate metadata.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add the following features to constant management?\r\n1. Constant groups (Similar to Program Indicator groups).\r\n2. Constant type: (to be considered):\r\na) \"regular constant\" (e.g. Pi,¬†‚àö2, etc).\r\nb) \"configuration constant\" (turning certain features of a program on and off).\r\n\r\n2.a Could constants also be configured to hide dashboardItems?\r\nThis is a feature similar to a ProgramRuleActionType.",

      "description": "It would be extremely valuable to be able to pull selected Category Options in Program Rule Expressions.  Specific Category Options in our use case eliminate the need to ask specific questions, while underline the importance of others.  The ideal would be something similar to how the V{orgunit_code} functions.\n\nRequest also appears in the community from Oct 8:[https://community.dhis2.org/t/accessing-category-option-for-program-having-a-category-combination-in-program-rules/37177](https://community.dhis2.org/t/accessing-category-option-for-program-having-a-category-combination-in-program-rules/37177)\n\nAs an example:\n\nIn the our system, we collect entomological information.  For more robust analysis we use category options quite heavily; one program alone has 5 categories associated with it.  The categories are quite varied; \n\n1. Insecticide being used in the test, \n1. Species being tested, \n1. Wall being tested, \n1. Time Period in the campaign\n1. Campaign specific Year of campaign\n\nDistinctions within the category options lead us to wanting to be able to have program rules associated with them.  \n\nSome Insecticides are ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù and would need to be tested over longer periods of times (i.e. more data elements), while other insecticides are not relevant at these longer periods and should not be answered.\n\nSimilarly, the kind of mosquito species that is tested will limit the options/presence of questions around the mosquito that is being used.\n\nFor now, and as further proof of the need for these values to control the experience of the form, we are actually collecting the same information in the category options again as data elements.  These data elements' main purpose is to allow for program rules to exist and be triggered so that the experience is as efficient as possible for the entrant.\n\nSpecific Example from VectorLink Collect:\n\n!image-20221019-183155.png|width=947,height=284!\n\nThis is our WHO Tube program, with 4 categories.  The program goes through a WHO Tube Test procedure to look at efficacy of insecticides (with/without synergists, at varying concentrations) which are used to spray houses to kill malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.  The category options are able to give much more powerful analytics without need for multiplication of program indicators, resulting in a much cleaner/easier process to create and present resulting information.\n\nThere are many aspects to these category options that could be used to determine the relevance of data elements in the form.  The most obvious one is the Insecticide Tested Category; depending on the category option selected, the insecticide will or will not be a ‚Äúlong-lasting insecticide.‚Äù  If the insecticide is long-lasting, the measurements of test extend to 7 days.  If the insecticide is not a long-lasting insecticide, the testing will stop at 24 hours.\n\nBecause of the above, we currently have reproduced the category and category options into a data element with option set to allow for this show/hide of relevant DEs based on selection.   Below is a quick GIF of the program rule that show and hide data elements for one section (though, for this program, this hiding actually hides from other sections as well).\n\n!WHO Tube Program.gif|width=942,height=965!",

There are some case patients doesn't come for follow up for long time or other words is lost to follow up. When patient return after a few month, we need to re-enroll the patient to the program again and restart the process and also want to see the history of patients. We consider this is the second episode. And there is a data element called Episode number. This episode number we would like to be generated automatically by using program rule.

During these training sessions, we are collecting demographic information such as age, gender, location, occupation and their DHIS2 login. Our end goal was to be able to tie their DHIS2 logins and requisite demographic statistics to understand what dashboards/charts/pivot tables they are using the most. This way we could tailor visualizations/data in general to specific groups of people (e.g. Males, 18-25 year olds, Nurses). Currently, the usage analytics are aggregated and therefore cannot get to this level of information. Knowing the \"Big Brother\" implications around this, we would even be happy to have similar demographics collected when a user is created and then aggregated by those in the usage analytics app. Either way, the functionality to have user level or demographic level analytics will help us tailor data/visualizations to groups of people and will down stream help us increase the standard of care in Malawi\n\nDisclaimer --> We have enabled and actively used Google Analytics, however, noticed the following, which inhibits us from using it the way we want to above. First, it is all anonymized data, meaning that we can't tie a user to a specific trend or pattern. Next, the location breakdown feature does not work in Malawi. I am not sure if the districts are just not loaded in, however, it does not disaggregate by region. Either way, we would want it by Facility/District, which it still will not give us. Finally, because the dashboards, especially on the app, use the same api link and therefore if someone is clicking through dashboards, it takes it as though it's the same one. \n\nThanks in advance!\nBrandon",

      "description": "Often, it is important to collect sensitive, personally identifiable information about clients to be able to track them longitudinally and to be able to offer clients personalized care through the continuum.  However, once a client‚Äôs engagement with the health program has ended or lapsed for a significant period, it may be unnecessary to continue to keep this personally identifiable information on the client.  In these instances, rather than retain sensitive, personally identifiable information indefinitely, it is recommended to implement a mechanism in program configuration to specify tracked entity attributes for eventual expiry for replacement with a null value, and the period of expiry.\n\nProposed implementation:  In the ‚ÄòAttributes‚Äô section of the tracker program configuration wizard, a ‚ÄòTracked entity attribute inactivity expiry‚Äô field would be added below the tracked entity attribute selection window.  This field would have options to select a common period of expiry for select tracked entity attributes.\n\nIn the tracked entity attribute table below, an additional column with checkboxes would be added to select whether each tracked entity attribute would ‚Äòrevert to null after expiry period‚Äô.  This would allow the individual selection of tracked entity attributes for expiry, such as personally identifiable information such as name, address, and phone number, while leaving the option to preserve other, less personally identifiable attributes (on their own) important for analytics, such as date of birth and gender.\n\nThe expiry period would be assessed based on the last date when a new event was added to the enrollment or a change to the enrollment was made (whichever is more recent).  If this ‚Äòlast updated‚Äô date indicates a period of inactivity in the enrollment beyond the expiry period threshold, the values in the selected tracked entity attributes would be set to null.\n\nAn alternative implementation would use the period selector of expiry for each TEA for more granular control, rather than a global expiry period applied to each TEA with a checkbox selected.",

      "description": "Currently we have users who have 20+ favorites on their dashboards, and from the server side of things, this looks like the users are abusing the api to bring the server down. We've worked with various team members at Oslo (with great success) to speed up aspects of analytics and this has mitigated the majority of failures and system lockups, but it is still a recurring problem we face. One user had a dashboard of 80 favorites that we had to reach out to individually to reduce this, as it was a reliable way to bring the server down.\n\nRequest:\nWe'd like the ability to limit the number of concurrent requests coming from the dashboard. Typical user behavior *today* involves opening a very large dashboard, making a cup of coffee, coming back and reviewing each of the results. New user behavior (with the introduction of the progressive dashboard) will be loading a very large dashboard, **scrolling to the bottom**, making a cup of coffee, coming back and reviewing each of the results.\n\nWe would like if the dashboard, even with progressive loading, would limit the number of *concurrent requests*, to prevent the new user behavior from having the **exact same impact** on the server as the current dashboard (the thing the progressive dashboard was constructed to prevent).\n\nSpecifically:\nWe propose a new integer system setting **Concurrent dashboard analytics requests** to appear on the Analytics settings screen of the System Settings app. It would be queried by the Dashboard app. If non-zero, it would limit the number of concurrent analytics requests initiated by the Dashboard app. If zero, there would be no limit (the default behaviour and the current behaviour).",

Right now, there is no way to see total file count, nor total space used without venturing in the SQL or the file system.\n\nOur needs are to see, per data element of type ‚ÄúFile‚Äù that it 1) exists, 2) the size, and 3) a link to the files inside the pivot table and event reports application at least. ‚ÄúSize‚Äù and ‚Äúexists‚Äù can also be used in the data visualizer and event visualizer. We‚Äôd like to see all three in the same pivot:\n\n!screenshot-4.png|width=200,height=183!\n\n \n\nThe implementation is up in the air, but one suggestion on presentation in the UI in the pivot table is to use the totals/Details\n\n!screenshot-12.png|width=200,height=183!\n\n \n\nSay I create a data element of type ‚ÄúFile‚Äù Called Monthly Report\n\nThis would appear like normal in the left for Totals, and would report on the ‚ÄúExists‚Äù which is akin to a COUNT only:\n\n!screenshot-13.png|width=200,height=183!\n\n \n\nWhen switching to details, it would offer Monthly Report (Exists), Monthly Report (File Size), Monthly Report (Link)\n\n!screenshot-14.png|width=200,height=183!\n\n \n\nAnother option would be separate all data elements of type ‚ÄúFile‚Äù into their own section in the Data Drop down:\n\n!screenshot-15.png|width=200,height=183!\n\n \n\nWhere those could be prepopulated for all data elements already (always in details mode). This would remove the need to locate these in either an ‚Äúevent data item‚Äù or a ‚Äúdata element‚Äù\n\nAs far as implementation, this could be added to some pre-canned COCs (like default) that are called: Exists, Size, Link, but that is just a suggestion.\n\nThis is necessary for DATIM because we are now having thousands of files uploaded and it would be good to use DHIS 2 as the dashboard to show what is coming in, and for whom it is coming in.",

They would have the added step of matching the root OU's UID before they upload on the new box, or uploading it as a second root, and deleting the first.\n\nAs an alternative:\n\nthe first time admin/district logs in, you provide a first login page that accomplishes those above tasks:\n\n** Please name your Root OU ************\n** Please name this OU level ************\n- and auto assign them\n\nAnd have an option to skip this step.",

I looked into it and yes it appears most elements do not contain any kind of \"id\" that would be easily addressable with an external CSS file. So even if the CSS was included, it doesn't look to be straightforward to make visual updates to the UI.\n\nSo we are left with a situation where that banner color changer is capricious in its effect, and confusing some long time users of DHIS 2.\n\nSince I'm 100% sure the DHIS 2 colors are hard coded *somewhere* in the react code or in java, I am requesting that you make it variable and provide a gui to provide alternate color schemes. This would live in system settings and consist of 9 different colors:\n\n !screenshot-1.png!\n\nWhich are applied like the following:\n\n !image-2017-12-14-13-43-07-057.png! \n\nThe banner colors can then be applied to both old AND new apps, as well as removing the need for CSS from any page but the login. This would seem to solve 90% of Companies, NGOs, and MoH's desire to offer a custom branded DHIS 2. Since it is very controlled, and used app wide, it wouldn't be whack-a-mole css and js updates which also might break parts of the app. The worst I could see happening would be people making monstrosities like the following:\n\n !screenshot-2.png! \n\nIn which case you could offer several \"prebuilt\" color choices as well.",

If a case investigation is to be completed within let us say 30 days, then the investigator's access to patient-identifiable details can be automatically revoked after e.g. 45 days unless the responsible disease coordinator over-rides it).\n\nAnother example of single user / single tracker access is the recently designed Integrated Community Service and Internship system for South Africa, where around 10,000 new graduates each year is able to apply for available posts all over the country for their one-year community service and/or their medical internship. In that case, each applicant needs access to all available data on available posts, accommodation, travel distances, and similar for the whole country - while they must ONLY have access to their own application (program instance) on the tracker side.",
