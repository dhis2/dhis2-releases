      "description": "**Problem Definition**\n\n**What problem or job are we addressing?**\n\nIn order to deploy DHIS2 applications efficiently and at scale, implementers including ICRC and many other partners face a persistent challenge: reducing reliance on traditional training sessions (virtual or in-person) to onboard users. This issue is not unique to ICRC or a specific use case; it is a universal barrier to efficient DHIS2 adoption across different countries, sectors, and implementations.\n\nWhile documentation and training materials exist, when these are hosted externally, users are less likely to access or engage with them especially when under time pressure, dealing with poor connectivity, or operating in resource-limited settings.\n\n**User Story and Scenario**\n\n**As a** DHIS2 user (e.g., a health worker using the RTS app for the first time),\n**When** I log into the app and feel unsure where to begin,\n**I want to** access a built-in tutorial that highlights core features, shows me what to do step-by-step, and adapts to my user role,\n**So I can** quickly become self-sufficient, confident, and productive without waiting for external training or guides.\n\nThis is especially relevant when:\n\n** Users return to the system after a long absence (e.g., due to staff turnover).\n** Solutions are updated or reconfigured, requiring quick re-orientation.\n** Implementers deploy the solution in new settings where training resources are limited.\n\n**Proposed Feature**\n\nIntroduce a configurable, embedded in-app tutorial system for DHIS2 Web and Capture apps that:\n\n** Appears on **first login** and is accessible anytime from a ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù menu.\n** Supports interactive, step-by-step walkthroughs that highlight key UI elements and actions (e.g., ‚Äúclick here to submit a report‚Äù).\n** Is role-aware, showing relevant steps based on user access levels.\n** Can be configured offline, allowing tutorials to be bundled with the application package for use in low-connectivity environments.\n** Offers anonymous usage tracking (optional), helping developers and implementers understand which tutorial steps are most helpful or confusing.\n** Enables customization by implementers, allowing them to include localized content, links to relevant resources, or context-specific instructions.\n\n**Who Faces This Problem & Why It Matters**\n\nThis challenge affects a broad spectrum of DHIS2 users globally from frontline health workers to data officers in humanitarian settings. It is especially pressing in:\n\n** Low-resource or fragile environments, where internet connectivity is unreliable and scheduled trainings are difficult.\n** Programs with high staff turnover, where onboarding must be repeatable and asynchronous.\n** Large-scale deployments, where central training is logistically complex and costly.\n\nFor many, the lack of in-app onboarding leads to:\n\n** Underutilization of key features,\n** Increased helpdesk load,\n** Delays in data reporting and decision-making,\n** Reduced satisfaction with the application.\n\n**Current Workarounds (and their Limitations)**\n\n**Current onboarding approaches include**:\n\n** Live virtual or in-person training sessions, which require coordination, bandwidth, and time.\n** Sharing PDFs, videos, or links to external learning platforms, which often go unused or are forgotten.\n** Embedding notes or ‚Äúhelp‚Äù text within the app, which lacks interactivity and user engagement.\n\nThese methods are often ineffective, especially when the user is new, overwhelmed, or in a hurry.\n\n**Expected Impact**\n\nAn embedded, interactive tutorial will:\n\n** Reduce onboarding time and support costs,\n** Improve user satisfaction and app adoption,\n** Support self-paced learning and re-orientation,\n- Foster broader usability in humanitarian and health contexts.",

      "description": "## üí≠ Problem definition\n\n### What problem or job are we going after?\n\nImages uploaded through tracked entity attributes or program stages (DEs) are automatically compressed to a medium quality to optimize for performance. However, this trade-off results in images that are sometimes visually degraded, making it difficult for users to clearly view important details in photos\n\nThere is no way for implementers or users to adjust image quality settings based on their context or needs\n\n### Proposed Solution:\n\nIntroduce an option to configure or choose image quality levels (e.g., low / medium / high) \n\n### Reference\n\nThis idea is based on [this DHIS2 Community post](https://community.dhis2.org/t/how-to-control-quality-of-uploaded-image/41407/6), where a user expresses the need for higher image quality, rather than simply reducing size. Currently, DHIS2 enforces medium-quality compression, with no option to change it.",

      "description": "There are 2 quite different types of events in the system, single events and tracker events. Single events are not tracker-based because they are not attached to a tracked entity but register a generic one-time event in a program.Tracker events, however, are linked to a tracked entity and a specific enrollment. Both types of events are modeled by the same objects and tables but some fields are specific only to one of them. For example, single events use an enrollment placeholder, with a null tracked entity, only to work the same as tracker events.\n\nModeling two different entities in the same way creates a few problems all over the system:\n\n** Different validations are applied to different types, so in the validation code is common to find the check to differentiate between types.\n** Missing fields that do not make sense for one or another type need to be added by preprocessors in the tracker importer. \n** ACL works differently in each type.\n** The placeholder enrollment can have ~thousands/millions of events while a tracker enrollment generally has few events. Mixing the two types in some parts of the code can lead to serious performance issues.\n** Rule engine works differently for program events and tracker events.\n** Event exporter need to deal with 2 different types of event and cannot be easily optimized.\n\nWe will there separate tracker events and single events in importer/exporter to improve all the points above as well as performance.",

I suggest that more filters be created so that users can select specific years, specific data sets, and also the organization units. This way, someone can easily generate analytic tables, for instance, for their planned training, without waiting 26 hours for the analytics to run. Very frustrating.*\n\n##",

Historically this parameter has been mostly used for timeliness of \"long transaction\" monthly aggregated data (the term \"long transaction\" is a term used for data processes that take considerable time - in the DHIS2 case typically 5-20 days after the end of the month). Disease surveillance data is different, because rapid submission of e.g. outbreak data is of vital importance for the early containment of epidemics. Such data is also increasingly being submitted directly from health facilities or clinicians, using browsers or the Android Capture app.\n\nDocumentation | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/42/42-collect-timely-submission.png) | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3",

These links lead to external resources, such as training material hosted on other platforms.\nWe would like to request the integration of a similar feature into the DHIS2 Android app. This would enable app users to access documentation, tutorials, or short videos directly from their mobile devices. The goal is to provide the same level of support and training resources for mobile users as we currently do for web users.\n**Proposed Features:**\n\n** **Resource Repository:** A section in the Android app where documentation, links, or videos can be attached and accessed.\n** **Dashboard Integration:** The ability to display and link these resources from within dashboards in the app.\n** **Offline Access :** An option to download specific resources for offline use.\nImpact:\nThis feature would greatly enhance user experience and ensure that DHIS2 app users have the necessary support and training resources at their fingaertips, fostering better adoption and utilization of the platform.\n**Steps to Reproduce (current behavior):**\n** Navigate to the DHIS2 web version.\n** Go to **Reports** > **Resource** and store links/documents.\n** Observe that these resources are not accessible from the Android app.\nThank you for considering this feature request!",

      "description": "As a DHIS2 implementer, I need the ability to delete scheduled messages using program rules when certain conditions are no longer met. This feature would enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of our notification system within DHIS2.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nCurrently, DHIS2 allows scheduling messages through program rules using the \"SCHEDULEMESSAGE\" action. However, there is no direct way to delete these scheduled messages using program rules when conditions change.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nImplement a new program rule action type called \"DELETESCHEDULEDMESSAGE\" that allows the deletion of previously scheduled messages based on specified criteria.\n\nDetailed Requirements:\n\n1. Add a new action type \"DELETESCHEDULEDMESSAGE\" to the list of available program rule actions.\n\n1. The action should accept parameters to identify which scheduled message(s) to delete, such as:\n\n** Program\n\n** Program Stage (optional)\n\n** Data element or attribute that triggered the original scheduled message\n\n** Original scheduled date range (if applicable)\n\n1. When the program rule condition evaluates to true, the action should remove any matching scheduled messages from the system.\n\n1. Provide appropriate error handling and logging for cases where no matching scheduled messages are found.\n\nUse Case Examples:\n\nIn a maternal health program, a message is scheduled when a pregnant woman's hemoglobin level is below a certain threshold. If a subsequent test shows improved levels, we need to cancel the previously scheduled follow-up message.\n\nIn a TB contact tracing program where data entry forms are strictly configured not to allow scheduling events, a message is scheduled when contacts are referred to a health facility and have not appeared at the health facility after 7 days. If the contact subsequently appear before the 7th day, the previously scheduled notification need to be deleted.\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n\n** This feature would likely require modifications to the program rule engine, notification schedules and the messaging subsystem.\n\n** Consider performance implications of searching for scheduled messages to delete.\n\n- Ensure proper access control so that only authorized program rules can delete scheduled messages.\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. Improved accuracy of notifications sent to patients and health workers.\n\n1. Reduced manual intervention required to manage scheduled messages.\n\n1. Enhanced ability to create dynamic, condition-based communication workflows.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nThis feature request is based on community discussions and the need for more flexible message management in DHIS2 programs. It aligns with the existing capabilities of scheduling messages through program rules and would complete the lifecycle management of these notifications.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or clarification on this feature request.",

It‚Äôs especially important for large organizations or country implementations where there are numerous dashboards for different programs, projects, or regions. These users need efficient dashboard organization to enhance usability, improve workflow efficiency, and reduce the cognitive load of finding the right dashboards for specific tasks.\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nCurrently, users work around this limitation by using naming conventions to group dashboards or manually scrolling through the dashboard list to locate the relevant one. This can be time-consuming, especially in implementations with a high volume of dashboards. Additionally, users may rely on keeping lists of dashboard names, but these approaches are neither efficient nor scalable in environments with complex dashboard structures.",

Healthcare facilities need to purchase all goods from the central medical store and have limited budgets. Therefore they would like to calculate the value of their orders ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù. This calculation is possible with a Program indicator but requires saving the Event, then moving to the analytics screen, checking the total value and then moving back to the main Event program screen.\n\n!image-20240926-153301.png|width=361,height=743,alt=\"image-20240926-153301.png\"!\n\n**As a storekeeper (DHIS2 user)**\n\n**When** ‚Äì placing an order in the dedicated Event program\n\n**I want to** ‚Äì view the updated total cost of my order on the Event home screen\n\n**So I can** ‚Äì adjust the ordered items and quantities without having to switch between UIs.\n\n**Who faces this problem**\n\nAll users of 90 healthcare facilities in the Comoros whenever they place their orders, usually two to three times per month.\n\n**How do they solve these problems today?**\n\nUsers calculate the order value manually with a calculator.",

Every storekeeper must use the most recent stock on hand data from the storekeeper on the previous shift or who worked on the previous day. However, currently the Capture Android app data is cached by user/instance/device which means that every storekeeper would be using the stock data from their previous shift, even if it was days or even weeks ago (in case of sick leave or holidays). This means that any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between two logins of a certain user, will always be wrong for every user. Two work arounds are available but are both not ideal for different reasons.\n\n**As a DHIS2 administrator**\n\n**When** ‚Äì implementing DHIS2-RTS (Real-Time Stock management tool) anywhere\n\n**I want to** ‚Äì force mobile devices to synchronise (only) the DHIS2-RTS Tracker program during login and logout\n\n**So the next user ‚Äì** will use the correct and most recent stock position (of the user which was previously logged in) and not the stock position of the user who is logging in. This user might have logged in the last time days ago (or even weeks ago in case of sick leave or holidays) and the cached stock position will be completely outdated.\n\n**Who faces the problem**\n\nThis problem was encountered during the current DHIS2-RTS implementation (September 2024) in the Comoros but all DHIS2-RTS implementations are affected.\n\nAll users are affected by this problem and if there is more than one user using the same mobile device, the stock position will always be wrong for all users. To be precise: any stock on hand which was changed by any other user between the login of a certain user, will be wrong.\n\n**Workaround**\n\nThe problem can be avoided by ensuring that all users synchronises the mobile device right after logging in and right before logging out. However, sooner or later a user will forget. Morever, the Internet connection is not always available and if a user cannot synchronise data before going home, s/he will not wait for the Internet to return.\n\nThe current solution is to simply ask all users to use the same credentials which is not ideal from a security point of view.\n\n**Proposed feature**\n\nThe DHIS2 Administrator has the option of ‚Äúforcing‚Äù the synchronisation for a specific Program after login and during logout in the Android-settings app which gives users a choice.",

However, I have observed that presenting the entire form at once can be overwhelming and may lead to data entry errors. \n\nTo enhance the user experience and improve data accuracy, I propose a feature that allows data collectors to view and respond to one question at a time, with the ability to navigate to the next question by swiping. This approach would help maintain focus on each question, reduce cognitive load, and ensure that data collectors can complete the forms efficiently and accurately.\n\n**Use Case:** **Expected Behavior:**\n\n** **Single-Question Display:** When a data entry form is opened in the Android app, only one question should be displayed at a time.\n** **Swipe Navigation:** Data collectors should be able to swipe left or right to move to the next or previous question, respectively.\n** **Progress Indicator:** A progress bar or a question number indicator at the top or bottom of the screen would help users track their progress through the form.\n** **Data Validation:** As each question is answered, the app should validate the input before allowing the user to proceed to the next question. If there is an error, an appropriate message should be displayed.\n** **Review Mode:* After completing all the questions, data collectors should have the option to review their answers before final submission, either by swiping through the questions again or by viewing a summary screen.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*This is faced by the DHIS2 Android Capture users (field workers).*\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*There‚Äôs not currently a way round this in DHIS2*\n\nThis feature would greatly enhance the data collection process, particularly in scenarios where attention to detail is critical. I believe it would be a valuable addition to the DHIS2 Android app and would be appreciated by many users in the field.",

      "description": "**Description:**\n\nWe propose the addition of wild card search and best match functionality within the DHIS2 Data Entry app to improve the efficiency and user experience of searching for organization units.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe current search functionality in the DHIS2 Data Entry/ Data visualizer app does not support wild card searches or best match results, which can hinder users' ability to quickly and accurately find specific organization units. Implementing these features will streamline the search process, reducing the time and effort required for data entry.\n\n1. Key Benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced User Experience:\n#** Users will be able to perform more flexible and intuitive searches, increasing satisfaction and productivity.\n1. Improved Efficiency:\n#** The ability to use wild card searches and view best match results will reduce the time spent searching for organization units, allowing users to complete data entry tasks more quickly.\n1. Greater Accuracy:\n#** Best match functionality will help users find the most relevant organization units, reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\n1. Scope and Requirements:\n\n1. Wild Card Search:\n#** Implement wild card search capabilities to allow partial matches. For example, searching for \"Hosp**\" should return all organization units that start with \"Hosp\".\n1. Best Match Results:\n#** Introduce an algorithm to rank search results based on relevance, displaying the best matches at the top of the list.\n1. User Interface Adjustments:\n#** Modify the search interface to accommodate and display these new search features clearly.\n\n1. ICRC Specific Needs:\n\n** The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) manages a large number of organization units. This vast hierarchy makes it challenging for users, especially those at higher levels, to find specific facilities quickly.\n** Variations in language and the use of accents or special characters can lead to inconsistencies in the names of organization units, further complicating the search process. For example, a facility's name might differ slightly depending on the language or presence of accented characters, making it difficult to locate using the current search functionality.\n** Implementing wild card searches and best match results will greatly assist our users by accommodating these variations and improving the accuracy and speed of their searches.\n\nPotential Impact:\n\nWhile the initial implementation may require adjustments in the backend search algorithms and interface design, the long-term benefits in terms of improved search efficiency and user satisfaction are significant. This feature will also position DHIS2 as a more user-friendly platform, potentially attracting more users and use cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe believe that adding wild card search and best match functionality to the DHIS2 Data Entry app is a valuable enhancement that will greatly benefit users, particularly within the ICRC, by making the search process more efficient and accurate. We request that this feature be considered for inclusion in the DHIS2 roadmap.",

This is especially so when working with program indicators, where there is no tracker/event data at all, the cell is left as a blank rather than have a zero. I would like to have the option of assigning this blank/null cell a color when creating the legend.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nWhen creating a legend, a user should be able to assign a color for null values as well (just like in maps). This way, if a user creates a pivot table and assigns it this legend, the cells which are blank/null will have the assigned color.",

      "description": "Understanding that space is a premium in a validation report UI, I think it would be helpful for two additional pieces of information to be prioritised in the output report that would **vastly** improve the usefulness of this report. (I am thinking the inclusion of this info is either in addition or in preference over existing info in the table. For example, the ‚Äúpriority‚Äù column could be taken out, and the report be grouped by section of high, medium, low, validation rules that could be expanded/collapsed by priority; and that would save the width of one column right away.) \n\n!image-20240612-114442.png|width=100%,alt=\"image-20240612-114442.png\"!\n\n*The curent validation rule analysis screen* missing *these key features.*\n\nThese new features are:\n\n** Instruction: this property is where we should be inputting the action a user should be taking (based on how it is used in the data entry app also) - in this report it would serve two purposes which are crucial. 1. It would help a user understand why the validation is showing in the first place (the name may not do that, which is in the table, so this is helpful extra context to help them know why the problem matters.) 2. It tells them what action should then be taken. \n** A link back to the data entry screen where rectification can then be taken to fix the value.\n**** If there is concern that a user with authority to run a validation analysis shouldn‚Äôt also be changing data - I‚Äôd suggest a toggle-able feature based upon the user authority for also being able to enter data.\n\nThank you - I think these two additions would be valuable. (In the interests of keeping this issue alive, let‚Äôs not say if you think one idea is good and one is bad, that both get thrown out - please adapt the issue. Ideally both would be good üòâ )",

The wide use of custom forms for aggregate data sets indicate that replicating the format/structure of the source document is the preferred way to do data entry from paper forms.\n\nThe current Capture app does not support this. First, custom forms are not supported, so attributes/data elements are always organised vertically with one field per row. Second, data entry is organised according to the design of the data model (i.e. attributes separately, forms split according to program stages).\n\nTracker data entry generally happens based on paper forms of two types:\n\n** Line lists, where each row represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n** Case/patient forms, where each form (e.g. A4 forms of one or more pages) represents one event or one TEI + one enrollment + one or more events\n\nThis proposal is to support data entry interfaces for these two use cases.\n\nIn both cases, it should be possible to design the form/line list independent of whether fields are attributes, enrollment dates, event dates or data elements. It should be possible to use a single data entry field to represent multiple variables (for example, a ‚Äúregistration date‚Äù field could be used both as enrollment date and event date for a particular stage).\n\nThe line list functionality should be reviewed against the plans for editable working lists. However, unless the whole process (enrollment, multiple events etc) can be done, editable working lists do not elleviate the need for a line list interface.\n\n## The source of inputs\n\nNeed for line list/tabular data entry interface was discussed during C19, it is mention in [+capture app user stories+](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U72P63ZJW-5PuZBqYCSuO9lj95YLm8dQ4-kFznjVTn8/edit#gid=773129706), and there have been community apps that do this for events. This is primarily based on reflecting over and discussing the current situation in countries and how we support that.¬†\n\n## The boundaries within which we should be analyzing (optional)\n\n----\n\nThe proposal is *not* about replacing the Capture app, which has much additional functionality beyond just data entry, but to complement it with more efficient and user-friendly ways of doing secondary data entry. Notably, since this is just about having a dedicated UI for data entry, implementations can combine or replace this with PoC data entry as they are ready; the underlying data model/configuration remains as today, and Capture can be used as today.",

      "description": "## üí≠ Problem definition\n\nCurrently, DHIS2 calculates completion rates taking into account all days, including weekends and public holidays. However, it has been identified that this approach can lead to inaccurate figures in EMIS, as weekends and public holidays should ideally be excluded from the calculation. Especially when you are collecting daily attendance data. As a consequence completeness rate can never be 100% even though data has been collected all the school days. Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Improved accuracy of completion rate calculations, providing more meaningful insights into attendance patterns.\n1. Better alignment of completion rate calculations with actual attendance data.\n1. Enhanced usability for organizations that require precise attendance analytics.",

If we want to give a user privileges to create/edit org units and assign dataSets and orgUnits makes it difficult to restrict the user not to edit the dataSets, programs, and category options. \n\nBefore being dropped, we used to have an assign dataset/program user role authority (and used in the pre-React DOM apps).\n\nIf we can re-introduce such a user authority, it can help dataset/program/category option assignment. For instance, we can perform assignments from outside like sharing, cloning, details etc.",

      "description": "## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nFor implementations in which the OU hierarchy opens and closes OU's constantly is difficult to work with the whole hierarchy, either for data entry or for the analytic apps. It would help having a tick to select the active org units, something like \"Show only active OUs\". This would hide the org units that are  currently closed (At the moment the user is using the system, not the reporting or selected period).\n\nFor analytics data displayed in results, would be enough to show data corresponding to the visible orgunits, independently from if any OU was opened during part of the selected periods. This is for day-to-day activities and users can work with the whole hierarchy if they want data from the past by not selecting this option.\n\nUser story:\n\nAs a **data analysis user**, I would like to be able to dinamically hide and show (toggle) closed org units in the analysis apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAs an **admin**, I would like to be able to hide closed org units in the data entry apps org unit hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, some mechanism for archiving (e.g. excluding from analytics) could be handy (OUs could go from active to close to archive).¬†\n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nAll data entry and analytics users in organizations that use an operational hierarchy. \n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nHaving an operational OU hierarchy instead of regional, OUs are opened and closed regularly (missions, projects, health sites, services‚Ä¶). As time passess by there are more and more closed (historic) org units. Normally there are more closed than open org. units. \nThey need to be kept in the hierarchy for retrospective analysis purpose, however for daily operations this becomes a barrier for user experience.\n\nCurrently, at admin level, we add the prefix ‚ÄúZZZ_‚Äù to the closed OUs so that they appear at the end of the list.\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nAn org unit is considered to be closed when the current date is outside the opening date and the closed date of the org unit. Refer to the {{openingDate}} and {{closedDate}} properties.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nCommunity (MSF and other NGOs that use operational hierarchies)\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nNot defined at the moment.\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|Would it be enough to ‚Äúhide empty rows?|No, for example to make a report by health facility.

You can frame this as a job-to-be-done:*\n\nMultiple implementing partners have different capacities in terms of the data that they capture. Some partners capture thousands of records per day, while others capture perhaps 50 records per day. The mobile phone app allows for previously captured records to be synced and available for editing but this number is limited based on the global Android App settings - the limitation is by OU or by Program (or a combination of the two). However, as many partners work in the same areas (i.e., OUs) and with the same programs, this means that the data download for some partners is extreme, while for others it is simply one week‚Äôs worth of work. \n\nAs a **DHIS2 instance administrator**\n\nWhen using the Android Settings app\n\nI want to set the synchronization limit based on User group as opposed to OU and Program\n\nSo I can support different implementing partners with different capacities and ensure that their data capture and review on the mobile phone app is clear and practical for their capacity and purposes.*.*\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\n*Describe which users, countries, or use-cases face the problem, as well as how important the problem is to them.*\n\nAll implementing partners have different capacity in terms of the extent of their data capture, the access to reliable internet, and the capacity of their mobile phones (better quality, faster devices vs. cheaper lower spec devices). Because of the synchronization needs, some users are adversely affected by large data synchronizations while others need large synchronizations for their daily work. \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, we have synchronization settings by both OU and Program, but this still adversely affects some users. The only workaround would be to create sub-groups of implementing partners to split the data being synced.

This affects any instance, in any country. The problem is key to ensuring that data capture remains of high quality and that the individual performances of team members can be monitored. \n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\n*Give examples as to how users solve these problems today.*\n\nCurrently, data managers have to export data using the import/export app in CSV format to then determine what data was captured by each individual. This adds multiple layers of complexity and effort to team performance monitoring. It is clear that the data is being captured in the DHIS2 database already, it would simply be beneficial to have this available as a DE so that graphs and linelists can be created to monitor team performance.  \n\nBy being able to see who captured data (an event without registration or an event with registration) the data manager would be able to confirm whether the data capturer is capturing all the required data, whether it is being captured correctly and whether the data capturer is meeting performance targets. For example, a vaccinator is tasked to vaccinate 100 people per day. The data manager would then be able to create a graph or linelist of the data captured by that individual based on the DE. As the DE is automatically completed with the username of the data capturer, the timeliness of data capture is not affected with a field that is repeated for every record captured. \n\n##",

However this case is very unlikely and therefore not part of the business requirements (as differentiation would require to also store the manufacturer name of every batch which would greatly complicate the system)\n\n** Batches are always managed and represented in the chronological order of their expiry dates (the user does not have the possibility to change the order in the interface) with the batch number with the shortest remaining shelf live (nearest expiry date) being displayed first\n\n** In the exceptional case of more than one batch number for the same item and the same expiry date, the system will display those items in the alphabetical order of their batch numbers\n\n** FEFO (first-expiry first-out) management by definition requires to deplete the entire stock of any batch before taking any quantity from the next batch\n\n** The system automatically \"hides\" any batches with a \"Stock\" of zero.\n\n** Different manufacturers use different conventions for expiry dates for example only indicating the month and year or the day, month and year and in various formats (without separation or dots or slashes as separators). However, these inconsistencies are not a concern for DHIS2-RTS as the expiry date has to be uploaded into the system and must be GS1 DataMatrix code compatible at that stage (regardless of the electronic data which is being loaded into DHIS2, any necessary conversions must be done by the national eLMIS system)\n\n** In alignment with current DHIS2 conventions, expiry dates are presented in the format YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY (all indicated as numbers) depending on the \"Calendar settings\" of the DHIS2 \"System Settings\" app\n\n** Batch number fields are alphanumeric (numbers and letters), may contain special characters such as blank spaces, hyphens, dots etc. and allow up to 20 characters\n\n** By default, the user interface displays only a list of items and the total quantities in stock but without any details of batch numbers and expiry dates (as this would lead to extensively long lists and users never need a complete list of all batches / expiry dates at the same time)\n\n** The user does not have the possibility of \"expanding\" the entire item list to show the batch numbers and expiry dates for all items (instead the user has to select a single item)\n\n** When the user selects any specific item (by search or by scanning) the sublist with the batch numbers and expiry dates is always displayed automatically (but always only for a single item at a time)\n\n** When the users scrolls down the list and taps on any item, this single item is displayed together with the sublist of batch numbers and expiry dates (in the same way as when an item is selected by searching or scanning)\n\n** Items without batches are displayed only as a single line (as in the overview list)\n\n** When the user has completed selecting the required quantities for each batch number and expiry date, the user selects a new button \"Select new item\" which takes her/him back to the item list for selecting the next item\n\n** Batches which have expired cannot be selected by the user\n\n**User interface for items selected by searching, tapping or scanning**\n\nThe batch number(s) and expiry date(s) are added to each item as a sublist in the following way (illustration is indicative and will be aligned to DHIS2 Android conventions):\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|81,000| |\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|23,000| |\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|4,000| |\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|13,000| |\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|8,000| |\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|33,000| |\n\n** the \"Stock\" in the header row (indicating the item) indicates the total quantity in stock (corresponding and always being identical with the sum of the quantities of every batch)\n\n** the \"Stock\" next to each of the batch numbers / expiry dates indicates the quantity on hand for each of the respective batches.\n\n**Work flow**\n\nThe entire logic of the workflow remains the same but there is a significant change in that the user must first select a single item before being able to enter any quantities This change is made to avoid the need for displaying an endlessly long list of all items and batches as well as for preventing user errors which are more likely if the batch numbers and expiry dates of many items are displayed in the same interface. This change also improves the user experience as the item description will always appear at the top of the list with ample place to display the batch numbers and expiry dates (only for this one specific item).\n\nThe other significant changes is that the user still enters the total required quantity but the system automatically calculates a suggestion for the quantities of each batch number and expiry date the user should pick according to FEFO (but allows the user to \"override\" the recommended selection which should be very exceptional).\n\n*The additional steps required in the workflow for the batch number and expiry date management are indicated in italics and in red*.\n\nUser:\n\n** receives a written request from departments, services or community health workers indicating a list of healthcare products and their quantities which are requested and need to be prepared by the pharmacy\n** starts the mobile device\n** open the DHIS2-RTS mobile app\n** selects the transaction type \"Distribution\" [\"Discard\" or \"Correction\"]\n** selects the \"Organisation Unit\" (name of the healthcare facility) if s/he has access to more than one\n** selects the ward/service etc. which is requesting the goods and for which the order picking is carried out\n** selects the first item by scrolling and tapping on the item, searching or using the barcode scanner\n** *as soon as any item is selected, the user interface displays a single item with the sublist of batches and expiry dates [new]*\n** *if the user made a mistake s/he can revert back to the item list at any time by selecting the \"back\" button (arrow) at the top left of the screen (any quantities entered are lost)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *are blocked from entering any \"Quantity\" for batches which are expired*\n** *the \"Review\" button is displayed at the bottom of the screen*\n** *if the quantity entered by the user exceeds the total available quantity, an error message is displayed, the user is blocked from proceeding and must reduce the quantity*\n** *system calculates the quantities of each batch (starting with the first FEFO batch) until the required quantity is reached and indicates the quantity calculated for each batch number and expiry date in the \"Quantity\" field*\n\n|Item / Batch number / Expiry date|Stock|Quantity|\n|DORAPARA5T - PARACETAMOL (acetaminophen), 500 mg, tab|21,000|60000|\n|EK4837NWP42Z / 08.2024|0|23,000|\n|JD42GTE34F / 11.2024|0|4,000|\n|ND84WL4ZE / 01.2025|0|13,000|\n|Q45JDW73R / 05.2025|0|8,000|\n|BRZT5K23RT / 10.2025|21,000|12,000|\n\n** *has the possibility of altering those quantities (but only up to the total of each batch, the user is not able to select quantities which lead to negative stocks)*\n** *taps in the \"Quantity\" field of the requested batch*\n** *the on-screen keypad opens*\n** *enters the total quantity required for any item*\n** *if the user changes the \"Quantity\" for any of the batch numbers, the total \"Quantity\" for the item will adjust to that change*\n** *selects \"Select next item\" button at the bottom right*\n** proceeds to search for or scan the next item\n** selects the \"Review\" button (on the user interface with the complete list of items)\n** system opens the \"Review\" interface and displays the \"Confirm\" button\n** system displays only the items with the total quantities which were selected\n** *if the user requires to review details at the batch number and expiry date level during the review s/he selects one item (at a time) by searching, tapping or scanning*\n** *system shows the item code of the selected item in the search window and one item with all the selected batch numbers and expiry dates with the selected quantities*\n** *reverts to the \"Review\" user interface by tapping on the \"x\" in the search window*\n** *system shows the \"Review\" user interface (only with items and the total quantities selected)*\n** selects the \"Confirm\" button\n** system reverts to the DHIS2-RTS home screen\n** informs the requester to pick up the goods are delivers them to the requesting department/service\n\n**Issues to be resolved**\n\n** Batches with a \"Stock\" of zero are not displayed by the system but if a mistake was made and the user needs to enter a \"Correction\" batch numbers and expiry dates with a \"Stock\" of zero need to be displayed in case stock is found to actually not be zero.

This way, these applications can achieve better performance and responsiveness, enhancing the user experience even on slow networks.\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\n414 URI TOO LARGE errors can cause issues that are difficult to work around in the field\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nWe assume that the user here are manually constructing API requests. A long API request URI can also be generated by a frontend app, which we should automatically mitigate in the future, but perhaps not in the first version \n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\n** 2024 Ideas Generation \n** Jason P \n** Internal \n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nMultiple API requests merged into one\n\n### How do they solve these problems today?\n\nDevelopers may divide a single request into multiple smaller requests to manage data retrieval. However, this approach isn't universally applicable: based on the filtering requirements, it may need to fetch additional data or metadata beyond the initial scope of interest.\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered*|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

This can be helpful if you are for example looking at all events assigned to you or available to you, but have access to several organisation units.\n\nDocumentation | Feature card | Screenshot 1 | 2 | 3\n\n## üí≠ Problem definition\n\n### What problem or job are we going after?\n\nAfter selecting a program in capture app (specifically an event program, not a TEI), a user has the option to select to see all events accessible to them. When configuring items to see in the data view via settings, there is no options for ‚Äúregistering unit‚Äù. I‚Äôve noticed this is available for TEIs, but not for event programs. I know we can see registration units in line lists, or even click into the org unit hierarchy to see records associated with that unit, but I think it would still be useful to see the registering unit when viewing all events together.\n\n### Who faces this problem and how important is it to them? \n\nCurrently, I work on a project that uses event programs in capture for 25 different districts and 5 provinces. Oftentimes, to do simple monitoring and checks, I‚Äôd rather see all events in a long list (including the registering unit), rather than clicking through each individual orgunit to see the events associated.\n\n### \n\n##",

They were difficult to find when users wanted to edit or consult them. In this version the details are displayed inside the form, as the first opened section for completion. Once they are filled in, for example when the user reopens the event or enrollment form, the details section will be visible and easily available, but collapsed to leave more space for the data collection.¬†\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*common*features*newEdit_event) | [Feature card](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-204-release-card.png) | [Screenshot 1](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-204-Image01.png) | [2](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-204-Image02.png) | [3](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/releases/screenshots/41/ROADMAP-204-Image03.png)",

For example, for calculating the number of items which are out of stock, the following indicator determines this for each Data element as \"1\" (stockout) and \"0\" (no stockout = stock is available) and then adds up the values for each Data element to a sum representing the total number of stockouts at an Organisation unit for any specific month:\n\nif(#{LNAkkMTxqEW.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{WyDZKSw82X6.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{JPccVwAGRq9.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{smxJz7Mt6ia.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{AaIApgGQM6t.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{vCTrmv52APd.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{SOw2TcuFFH2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RSIOx2u07Ln.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{JStiDyaPfqy.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{hZ1YvdcTDQM.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{tsi32D8HQd5.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{QWlPF8S0gCc.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{a5uLTDt12eT.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{U0AfOOyJMy2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cyf6UdScfFM.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{FeUTTNHpVzD.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{mKSICD1rxG4.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{mVNe1aS1pGl.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{oLAXTZY6ken.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{YYaRDUZyH9L.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{HVteopBt0jr.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{sWodd2tbjgZ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{yVYajDDYUfX.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{eTJAr4sc83v.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{U4KSmanl4JP.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{FXsa5uG3IGn.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{L34T9YDtCor.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{W5mHXhSYFfQ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cmSUyJOZwyl.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{cT8sfosRXvU.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{OaWKnMS7say.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Z4bjHvGS6aH.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Nn1L7CNEtC8.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RNYKSc3nAUg.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{PtmZ9XqpPKi.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{CohlLHi54B0.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Gu6u82RD9OW.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{LiuYzxYr4Pt.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{Tje33nJAG55.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{euM2dlqleYH.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{dASLmBTEehF.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{qU2LvzoPn1z.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{OkWaFxdUQY2.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{YHIv7KQc2e7.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{rt9D47Inb49.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{i1iXbquZ5iv.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{RcE30WBKrXI.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{EAG0GfdSMAs.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{N2aXs7VlJdJ.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)+\n\nif(#{xrjnOtFFTRC.iIC4YhgrxQY}==0,1,0)\n\n**As a [DHIS2 user]**\n\nAs a DHIS2 (LMIS) user\n\n**when** - creating Indicators across many Data elments in a Data element group\n\n**I want to -** easily create the indicator by indicating the Data element group (instead of each Data element UID separately).

The global shell will ensure consistent headerbar and command pallet as well as other common global functionality such as alerts, session management, and more.\n\nOptional support for a global app shell has been released in DHIS2 v41.  By default, web applications are served independently.  However, an application with the name ‚Äúglobal-app-shell‚Äù can be optionally installed and will subsequently be served instead of individual web applications.  All applications, both bundled and installed, will be harmonized and served from the {{/apps}} path, rather than for example {{/dhis-web-dashboard}} or {{/api/apps/my-app}}.  Accessing apps at their previous paths will redirect the user to the new location.\n\nAs a fallback, apps can be accessed directly at their old locations by appending the {{?redirect=false}} query paramenter.  For example, the app management app can be accessed directly from the browser at {{/dhis-web-app-management/index.html?redirect=false}} - this is useful for uninstalling a misbehaving global app shell, for example.",

Some main uses of this would be to  support a public sector and private sector structure, a local country‚Äôs national hierarchy and an NGO operational hierarchy, managing multiple sectors within the same instance.\n\nuseful in order to have facilities and campaign programs in the same instance\n\nThis has been in high demand for malaria programs and campaign implementers, so that programs can have community-level org units like villages that do not fit well into the master org unit hierarchy\n\nWill be very useful in scenarios where a single ministry has multiple hierarchies\n\nAllow for support multiple ministries at government with different administrative structures\n\na lot of programs use additional implementation units that they need to be able to track indicators at (e.g. village, locality) that do not necessarily fit neatly into a hierarchical relationship with health facilities\n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nFor the **Sri Lankan** context, it's crucial to prioritize the implementation of support for multiple hierarchies with different administrative structures within our health sector.\n\n**Pakistan** want to combine public and private sector hierarchies \n\n**MSF** would like this to use both national/administrative hierarchy and MSF operational hierarchy\n\n**Ethiopia** needs this for its multi-sectoral district level M&E. Key at the multi-sectoral practice is dealing with multiple institutions that bring their own administrative hierarchies - like schools, health centers, food production and processing sites‚Ä¶. that require multiple orgunit hierarchy\n\nThis is needed in the **South African** context\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nCountries with several hierarchies have been struggling to manage data and access and ending up having multiple DHIS2 instances for each hierarchy.\n\n**GHFD SubWG RMR**\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nSince this is dealing with one of the fundamental building blocks of the data model so any changes will be extensive and take a lot of effort.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nWhat were the sources of input for this requirement\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nList the features discussed which are out of scope or might be revisited in a later release.\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|Could improving multi instance architecture reduce the needs for this, by providing an alternative solution?| |Type // to add a date|\n|Could integration with common geo-registries  handle this use case?| | |\n|Should this be considered alongside enhanced master facility list and profile features?| | |",

For example with the DHIS2 for education implementation in Uganda, we are working on departmental dashboards pulling data from one single tool - the termly tool. We would therefore like to have a dashboard label for Termly Tool data and then below have various tabs to navigate the different pages under there such as school health, school feeding etc. Example below:\n\nThis is how the dashboards currently are. We had to create individual dashboards for each of the departments which are pulling data from the same tool.\n\n¬†\n\n¬†\n\nThis here is what we suggest, is it possible for us to have a single dashboard but within there, one can have tabs through which a user can navigate to view the different categories of data.\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01 (1).png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 12.43.01.png|width=1787,height=424!\n\n!dashboard tabs (1).jpg|width=1640,height=924!\n\n!dashboard tabs.jpg|width=1640,height=924!",

This default MAY also be enforced, if the default is enforced, the API will reject any searches with other operators for the given tracked entity attribute.\n## The default is defined in the Maintenance app, and stored on the tracked entity attribute, and will be interpreted by the clients.\n## The LIKE operator is the one most likely to cause slow performing queries(first observed profiling the Rwanda EPI instance but also match expectation). Therefore the maintenance app will pre-select EQUALS or other suiting operators if the user does not make an explicit choice of search operator.\n1.

      "description": "## Release Notes Description\n\n**New Capture Coordinates process:**  Introducing new features designed to enhance the capture coordinates process. These improvements aim to provide greater accuracy, flexibility, and control over location data capture.\n\n** **Accuracy:** The capture coordinates process now includes a feature that displays the precision of the captured location. This allows users to see how accurate their location data is in real-time. This parameter can also be restricted using the Android Settings WebApp.\n** **Search Functionality:** A new search functionality has been added, allowing users to look up specific locations by name or address. Users are also able to navigate through the map and perform area searches to discover other locations within a specified region. \n** **Block Manual Capture:* Using the Android Settings Web App, administrators now have the option to block manual location capture. When this setting is enabled, users can only capture the current location and cannot manually select or search a different one. This ensures that location data remains consistent and accurate.\n\n[+Jira+](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/ANDROAPP-6330) | [+Release card 1+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-disabled-manual-capture.png) | [+Release card 2+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-accuracy.png) | [+Release card 3+](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content.dhis2.org/dhis2-android/release+notes+3.1/release+cards/Android-3-1-map-search.png) | [+Documentation1+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/program-features.html#capture*app*programs*common*features*map*accuracy) +|+ [+Documentation 2+](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/android-app/settings-configuration.html#capture*app*android*settings*webapp*appearance*program*specific)\n\n## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nThe Android App needs to display the current accuracy in the coordinates selector when capturing current location. This provides a helpful prompt to recapture if the accuracy is low. Without this visual indicator, users capture very inaccurate coordinates without realizing. \n\nThis need applies to any coordinate capture using the mobile app - Enrollment, Event and data element coordinates.\n\nThis will provide much-needed accuracy to community-level data capturing. which will ensure improved quality of geo coordinates especially at the household level. overall, good accuracy improves quality of data entry at the community level.\n\n## :people*holding_hands: Users description\n\nHelpful in urban and rural environments across multiple users and teams (EPI, bed nets, deliveries, entomology sentinel sites) and associated varied devices. Translates to cleaner map visuals for all MOH levels, partners, funders.\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nWhen users are collecting coordinates with their mobile phone, the accuracy of the actual coordinates is not displayed in the user interface. However, GPS coordinates can be extremely inaccurate, but we know that accuracy improves with time or if the user captures coordinate 2-3 times. \n\nThe GPS feature currently is not trustworthy, and users need to confirm their GPS location as sometimes the signal is not very strong, resulting in inaccurate data capture. \n\nWithout displaying accuracy information, it is very easy to just tap it and forget about whether the reading is accurate or not. Users are constantly capturing inaccurate GPS coordinates, simply because they are not getting visual feedback to re-capture. Displaying the accuracy will allow implementers to train users on leveraging this information to try capturing a few more times to let the accuracy increase .\n\nIn door to door data collection deliveries and sometimes the coordinates don't come as accurate as users don't have idea of the accuracy then collecting the coordinates.",

In most cases, this information is not necessary to be included in analytics, and should not be exposed or exported from the system without the deliberate design choice to do so.\n\n|Role/domain - Functionality - Motivation|\n|As a system administrator, I want to be able to make sure that PII will not be available through the analytics apps / exportable / exposed through the API|\n|I still want to be able to exchange PII with other patient-based systems|\n|As a user administrator trying to limit the access to personally identifiable data, want to prevent non-clinical users from having access to attributes that are central for identification, so that as few people as possible have access to identifiable information.|\n|As a system administrator, I want the analytics process to consume as few resources as possible, so that the overall system performance is penalized as little as possible.|\n|I want to be able to see aggregations of the data (indicators) but not individual level data|\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nPII appearing in linelists or included in data exports\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\n** System configurers already have options on tracked entity attributes that allow them to be excluded from search, or not shown in lists.

      "description": "## üéØ¬†High Level use case \n\nIndividuals and community members are active participants in their own health and the health of their communities.Empowering individuals to report on their own health data through mobile solutions enables more *robust data collection* and facilitates *task shifting* among the health workforce. Health workers‚Äô time traditionally spent on data collection & reporting can be reallocated to improve data analysis and patient-centered care. Finally, self-reporting and feedback loops can expand the reach of health interventions and data systems to individuals who face barriers accessing health facilities.¬†\n\nSelf monitoring implies that patients can access their own health record and consult and update their own health data. In some cases patinents will only need to see their data wihtout need to edit. \n\nThis use case is extended here> [https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/jira/polaris/projects/ROADMAP/ideas/view/4066207?selectedIssue=ROADMAP-136) \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nPatients that are already registered in a health program.\n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nIn some cases / health programs patients are in really remote areas and having health staff monitoring them is not feasible, not even community health staff. Some programs requiere dayli upadtes and patients are requested to keep track of themselves and then, weekly or bi-weekley, when visited by a health worker they report all that information that is in many cases forgotten or not well recorded. Visits of this nature also take  alot of time.\n\nIn other cases, for example an epidemic, even if patinets are reachable, is simply not manageable to monitor them on daily basis, or not recommended for infectious risks. \n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nThe patient is already regitsered in the system.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nThis use case was already studied during covid. The source are many inputs from the community. \n\nReference douments from that study can be found here: \n\n** [Self reporting concept note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uGMxHg*02UaJvpnPldRJ2uBBlK2UsyibPiwjXC*JGQg/edit#heading=h.midsb1pv3ak1)\n** [Self reporting user stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cB0YP*tS0ZL4wdaJQSN1wuDo*SLj6R9tO-LnaehBXiQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nSelf reporting could be addressed at different levels (see below). This Idea is refering to number 5. Self monitoring. The other use casesa re out of scope.\n\n1. Self assessment: mobile tools that enable an individual to make a self-assessment about whether he/she has COVID-10 symptoms\n1. Self reporting of aggregate/non-identifiable data: these user stories included mass surveys for individuals to report in whether or not they have COVID-19-like symptoms; only aggregate data are captured primarily for public health analytics purposes\n1. Self-identification: an individual is ‚Äúunknown‚Äù to the health care system and make themself known through software (e.g. Tanzania hotline: individual calls hotline and phone number is pushed to DHIS2 event program through USSD solution for follow up\n1. Self-registration: an individual records their own details to ease the burden of the health workers on registration (e.g. a patient ‚Äòself enrolls‚Äô into a suspected COVID-19 case program\n1. Self-monitoring: an individual has had contact with the health system to be enrolled into some sort of longitudinal monitoring program, but they submit data themselves during the course of follow up period (e.g. an individual is registered into DHIS2 program by a CHW as a contact of a confirmed case and submit updates everyday for 14 days about whether or not they have developed symptoms)\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|How will patinets identify/authenticate themselves?| | |",

Some examples include looking up demographic information from an external client registry / looking up terminologies from a terminology service / etc.\n\n## ü§î¬†Assumptions\n\nThis request can already be solved on web only with tracker data entry plugins (v41) and the routes API (v40).  However, the request remains to solve this more generically through configuration (define an API lookup including query parameters and response mappings.\n\n## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Sources\n\nPAHO, WHODrug, ICD-11, KS\n\n## (!)¬†Out of Scope\n\nExternal APIs will not work offline, so we will need to have some fallback\n\n## (?)¬†Open Questions\n\n|**Question**|**Answer**|**Date Answered**|\n|e.g., How might we make users more aware of this feature?|e.g., We'll announce the feature with a blog post and a presentation|Type // to add a date|",

Terms are a date range that is uniquely defined every year and are unique to countries, hence global, generic terms do not exist. Terms include school holidays and breaks that should not be included as expected days of reporting. \n\nThis could be generically applied to cohort, unique financial years, EPI weeks, or campaign periods analysis where data ranges are used to define cohorts and analytics should be applied/isolated to those date ranges. \n\n## :people*holding*hands: Users description\n\nUsers are analytics and data entry users that need to capture or visualize data by term. \n\n## ‚ùì Problem Description\n\nThe issues is that DHIS2 does not allow for configurable period ranges to be used for data entry or analytics.

Backend supports merging the following metadata objects through the web API: Organisation Units, Data Elements, Indicators, Indicator Types, Category options, Category option combinations (limited to one use case, when the Category option combinations are the same). Frontend support through the user interface is gradually implemented as well. So far the new Maintenance app supports merging options for Category options, Indicators and Indicator types.

When creating or editing a metadata element (e.g., a data element or indicator), I should have the option to upload and link images or media files as visual references.\n1. Each attached image or media file should be associated with a specific metadata element, allowing it to serve as a visual guide or example for data collectors.\n1. Data collectors should be able to access these visual references when entering data for the corresponding metadata element, providing them with visual context and clarity about the data to be collected.\n1. The system should support common image and media formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, MP4) for attaching visual references.\n1. There should be clear documentation and guidance on how to upload and manage visual references for metadata elements.",

Please find attached a screenshot of completeness rate for daily attendance\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Improved accuracy of completion rate calculations, providing more meaningful insights into attendance patterns.\n1. Better alignment of completion rate calculations with actual attendance data.\n1.

This should allow them to actually add a metadata object (option) to a corresponding option set and make it available to other users on the fly.\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-3674](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-3674) \n\n{quote}The scenario where you have a data element with an option set but where you are NOT blocked from entering free text is very useful in many contexts. At the moment, this is typically handled by adding multiple additional data element or attributes, where one of them is called e.g. \"Other\" and with a free text \"Specify\" attribute/element to hold the free text. While the latter method is OK where you have a multi-choice list, it is a pain where you have a single attribute or data element with an option set.\n\nNote: in e.g. MS Access, this would be similar to the \"Limit to list y/n\" attribute for data fields - you can specify if only optionsetvalues are allowed or else if not then you can select from a drop-down OR enter free text).\n{quote}",

      "description": "Hello!\r\n\r\nFor the new tracker import endpoint where it is possible to trigger the program rules on the program (which is very cool, by the way) it would be super helpful to be able to selectively choose which rules to trigger based upon the action.\r\n\r\nThis would mean including a parameter in the post request like \"triggerAction= \" (though obviously call it whatever makes sense) and then be able to array all rule actions required to trigger (i.e. those listed in the [docs](https://docs.dhis2.org/en/use/user-guides/dhis-core-version-237/configuring-the-system/programs.html#create*program*rule)).¬†\r\n\r\nSo for example, triggerAction=assignValue,showError - would trigger only the assign value and trigger error rules at import.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use-case?¬†\r\n\r\nWe have programs which have plenty of skip logic for hide fields - accounting for about 90% of the PRs. The other 10% are show warning, show error, assign value, or mandatory field. We are attempting to import 1000s of events for these programs at once, and the data was completed in such a way that we know the front-end relevant hide/show logic has been respected. When importing currently on a very large server, and parsing events in chunks, the CPU usage spikes (or crashes); whereas turning off the PRs on these programs solves the issue - but is not a reasonable fix. It also appears the tracker import is attempting to trigger all the hide fields logics to test they're being respected; but as noted, this is largely irrelevant. By being able to selectively trigger rule actions it will help reduce server burden and speed up the process of import - which will be a routine (i.e. monthly in >20 countries) process.",

      "description": "The advent of the \"text pattern\" for tracked entity attributes was a big win for the generation of auto-generated IDs based upon a pre-defined pattern. The new feature of this ticket requests the ability to auto-generate IDs through tracker domain type data elements, as well.\n\nThis is because it can often be useful to auto-generate an ID in event programs (or certain program stages of a tracker program) where data elements are in play, and not TEA.\n\nUse-cases:\n\n** In NTD programming, an auto-generated ID is used per event (survey) to designate an ID to the particular survey¬†*and*¬†another ID to a particular survey moment. (For example a planned survey gets an ID, and if it is carried out as intended it receives the same ID again. Whereas if that survey gets delayed, perhaps because of COVID, the survey moment ID is generated anew and would be different to the original.)\n** In certain event programs where individuals are measured, they may require a random case ID.\n** I'm sure there are plenty more, but they escape me right now üòâ\n\n**Other Jira sources:**\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-1994](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-1994) \nCurrently, only Tracked Entity Attributes can be configured to be auto-generated and possibly unique values (see separate JIRA issues for specifications of pattern-defined case values).\n\nA similar type of Data Element is urgently required for Disease Surveillance, where you typically set up a \"Contact Tracing\" (tracking people who has been exposed to a pathogen or an infected individual) stage to store names, address, phone numbers etc for contacts being traced and monitored. Each such contact will have a unique Contract Tracing ID.\n\nNOTE in this context that whereas we CAN use a \"Child Program\" for tracking contacts, we find it's better to use a repeatable stage for it - mainly due to the very limited options in DHIS2 for analysing data from multiple programs.\n\n[https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-19558](https://dhis2.atlassian.net/browse/DHIS2-19558) \n\nWe are implementing a Birth Notification program using a **DHIS2 Event Program**. However, we have identified a key limitation: unlike Tracker Programs, Event Programs do not support the use of a **unique identifier per event instance** that can be referenced independently across systems or used for tracking individual submissions over time.\n\nIn our use case, it is crucial to associate each birth notification event with a **globally unique identifier**, similar to the {{Tracked Entity Instance UID}} in Tracker Programs. This UID would facilitate:\n\n** **Interoperability**: Enable linkage with other systems (e.g., CRVS, HMIS, or Civil Registration) through consistent identifiers.\n** **Data reconciliation**: Allow deduplication or merging of data based on the unique ID.\n** **Audit and traceability**: Provide a consistent reference for follow-up or verification processes.\n\n**Suggested Implementation:**\n\n** Introduce an optional **auto-generated UID** field for Event Program instances.\n** Alternatively, allow configuration of a custom unique identifier field (using program-stage data elements) with enforcement of uniqueness.\n** Ensure this UID is exposed via API endpoints and UI views (e.g., Event Reports, Event Capture).\n** Ideally, support integration with identifier generation strategies (e.g., UID, UUID, sequential number with prefix).\n\n**Use Case Context:**\n\n** **Country**: South Sudan\n** **Program**: Birth Notification (Event Program)\n** **Challenge**: Current design lacks a persistent reference ID, creating challenges in referencing events externally.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n** A unique identifier can be auto-generated or configured in an Event Program.\n** Identifier is accessible via API, UI, and exports.\n** The identifier behaves similarly to Tracked Entity Instance UID in terms of persistence and uniqueness.",

So, if an annual data set is chosen and data is entered in the current period (2021), and -6 months is chosen, then the selected cells would lock in June 2021 (i.e. -6 months from the end of the period)\r\n\r\nAdditionally a user authority to override the lock.\r\n\r\n**Within an event/tracker program:**\r\n\r\nA program rule action should be created to \"lock value\" - which would mean a value is locked should a user go back to edit an event at a later date. This could be triggered using an expression like \"d2:daysBetween(V\\{event*date},V\\{current*date}...)\r\n\r\nAgain, the same user authority should allow the override of this lock.\r\n\r\n***Use-case:***\r\n\r\nIn NTD programming, Work planning is carried out to define which EUs within a Country should have a survey or not. Given extenuating circumstances a planned survey may be cancelled or postponed. For example, in a COVID year like 2020. It is important to know when the survey was postponed or cancelled but the original planned date of the survey should not change. There needs to be a window of time to allow the planning to occur, but after 3 months of the planned year have passed, it should not be possible to change the planned survey date; but rather the date should \"lock in\" and the actual survey date should be used. (Users have a habit of wanting to get hteir planned and actual dates aligned and so edit both.)",

It would be very useful to make it easier for users to find the dashboard/information they are looking for if a superuser could group dashboards together so that they appear as a single entity at the top of the screen, and when clicked worked something like the organization unit hierarchy. I can think of examples where multiple layers maybe used, something like groups and group sets, but even a single layer of grouping would be useful.",

      "description": "It would be extremely valuable to be able to pull selected Category Options in Program Rule Expressions.  Specific Category Options in our use case eliminate the need to ask specific questions, while underline the importance of others.  The ideal would be something similar to how the V{orgunit_code} functions.\n\nRequest also appears in the community from Oct 8:[https://community.dhis2.org/t/accessing-category-option-for-program-having-a-category-combination-in-program-rules/37177](https://community.dhis2.org/t/accessing-category-option-for-program-having-a-category-combination-in-program-rules/37177)\n\nAs an example:\n\nIn the our system, we collect entomological information.  For more robust analysis we use category options quite heavily; one program alone has 5 categories associated with it.  The categories are quite varied; \n\n1. Insecticide being used in the test, \n1. Species being tested, \n1. Wall being tested, \n1. Time Period in the campaign\n1. Campaign specific Year of campaign\n\nDistinctions within the category options lead us to wanting to be able to have program rules associated with them.  \n\nSome Insecticides are ‚Äúlong-lasting‚Äù and would need to be tested over longer periods of times (i.e. more data elements), while other insecticides are not relevant at these longer periods and should not be answered.\n\nSimilarly, the kind of mosquito species that is tested will limit the options/presence of questions around the mosquito that is being used.\n\nFor now, and as further proof of the need for these values to control the experience of the form, we are actually collecting the same information in the category options again as data elements.  These data elements' main purpose is to allow for program rules to exist and be triggered so that the experience is as efficient as possible for the entrant.\n\nSpecific Example from VectorLink Collect:\n\n!image-20221019-183155.png|width=947,height=284!\n\nThis is our WHO Tube program, with 4 categories.  The program goes through a WHO Tube Test procedure to look at efficacy of insecticides (with/without synergists, at varying concentrations) which are used to spray houses to kill malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.  The category options are able to give much more powerful analytics without need for multiplication of program indicators, resulting in a much cleaner/easier process to create and present resulting information.\n\nThere are many aspects to these category options that could be used to determine the relevance of data elements in the form.  The most obvious one is the Insecticide Tested Category; depending on the category option selected, the insecticide will or will not be a ‚Äúlong-lasting insecticide.‚Äù  If the insecticide is long-lasting, the measurements of test extend to 7 days.  If the insecticide is not a long-lasting insecticide, the testing will stop at 24 hours.\n\nBecause of the above, we currently have reproduced the category and category options into a data element with option set to allow for this show/hide of relevant DEs based on selection.   Below is a quick GIF of the program rule that show and hide data elements for one section (though, for this program, this hiding actually hides from other sections as well).\n\n!WHO Tube Program.gif|width=942,height=965!",

      "description": "Often, it is important to collect sensitive, personally identifiable information about clients to be able to track them longitudinally and to be able to offer clients personalized care through the continuum.  However, once a client‚Äôs engagement with the health program has ended or lapsed for a significant period, it may be unnecessary to continue to keep this personally identifiable information on the client.  In these instances, rather than retain sensitive, personally identifiable information indefinitely, it is recommended to implement a mechanism in program configuration to specify tracked entity attributes for eventual expiry for replacement with a null value, and the period of expiry.\n\nProposed implementation:  In the ‚ÄòAttributes‚Äô section of the tracker program configuration wizard, a ‚ÄòTracked entity attribute inactivity expiry‚Äô field would be added below the tracked entity attribute selection window.  This field would have options to select a common period of expiry for select tracked entity attributes.\n\nIn the tracked entity attribute table below, an additional column with checkboxes would be added to select whether each tracked entity attribute would ‚Äòrevert to null after expiry period‚Äô.  This would allow the individual selection of tracked entity attributes for expiry, such as personally identifiable information such as name, address, and phone number, while leaving the option to preserve other, less personally identifiable attributes (on their own) important for analytics, such as date of birth and gender.\n\nThe expiry period would be assessed based on the last date when a new event was added to the enrollment or a change to the enrollment was made (whichever is more recent).  If this ‚Äòlast updated‚Äô date indicates a period of inactivity in the enrollment beyond the expiry period threshold, the values in the selected tracked entity attributes would be set to null.\n\nAn alternative implementation would use the period selector of expiry for each TEA for more granular control, rather than a global expiry period applied to each TEA with a checkbox selected.",

      "description": "A current challenge for users building program rules is the need to be able to access option sets within the maintenance module to view the options, value types, and codes.  If the user does not know particular option set or value type assigned to a data element or tracked entity attribute, there is also the additional step of checking the data element or TEA for this information in the maintenance module.  This makes the process for creating program rules cumbersome.\n\nProposed implementation:\nIn the ‚ÄòEdit program rule expression‚Äô section of the program rule configuration wizard, in the right pane, program rule variables would be listed along with their associated value type in brackets eg. [TEXT], [DATE], or [NUMBER].  An arrow to the left of each program rule variable with an assigned option set would denote that it was capable of being expanded to show a list of options that could be selected and added to an expression.\n\nIn the ‚ÄôDefine program rule action‚Äô window, for certain actions such as ‚ÄôAssign value‚Äô, where an ‚ÄôExpression to evaluate and assign‚Äô is present, there would be a similar display for value types and options, where appropriate.  This would affect the following action types:\nAssign value\nDisplay key/value pair\nDisplay text\nError on complete\nSchedule message (limit variables displayed to only ‚ÄòDate‚Äô type variables)\nSend message (limit variables displayed to only ‚ÄòDate‚Äô type variables)\nShow error\nShow warning\nWarning on complete",

Furthermore, there should be a possibility to have a system generated \"other\" category that will put together data for the remaining causes that are not in the leading causes.",

Can we add a validation rule to keep the coordinates in a particular range (either min/max or within a boundary layer). They mix up longitude and latitude or enter totally incorrect numbers, leading to events appearing in the ocean. We would like data collectors to see at the time of data entry that their event is showing up outside of the country. Because the coordinates field is not a data element or attribute, can't create a validation rule the normal way.",
